    "reviewText": "I love this phone case. It’s not bulk or slippery and I love the shimmer. I also use a metal magnetic mag safe pop socket and it sticks amazingly. I’ve dropped my phone several times with this case on and it protects it. Otter box is great! I just bought a new one to replace my old one, which was about a year and a half old. They last a long time but it will yellow over time. I recommend replacing once a year to keep it looking clear and pretty.",

    "reviewText": "I love this case! I had recently cracked the entire back of my phone due to having a non- protective case on it. I ordered this otter box because it’s cute but also provides protection. It fits my phone perfectly and is very comfortable to hold. It has protected the camera in the back and is very durable - I don’t even have a scratch on it yet!",

    "reviewText": "I’ve been through a few phone cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and haven’t found one that fits it well (particularly around the rear facing camera)…until now! I don’t understand how so many different cases don’t fit something as popular as an iPhone (especially in the exact same place and way). The magnet is the right amount of strength too, not at all weak so holds on to my car mount, but easy to remove if you are intentionally trying to remove it from a mount or charger.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Bad quality case and the worst customer support of my life",
    "reviewText": "The case was very nice for a week or two and then stretched so bad that my phones corners were constantly popping out of it. I had to pop the phone back into the case every time i took the phone out of my pocket. Also the more rubbery part of the case (the sides that stretched) yellowed a lot after just a couple of weeks of use. Could not return it to Amazon bc i didnt have the original box so I submitted a warranty claim on the Otterbox website. They asked for photos and said that my case might qualify for a replacement and i need to ship it back to them. They said that they couldn’t provide a shipping label but my shipping fee will be waived on their side. Liars. So i go and spend $30 on shipping it back, send them the receipt and they say they are not going to reimburse it now. Would not even give me a gift card for that amount. So i end up spending $80 on a bad quality product that i dont even have anymore. I ask them if they can at least send me a replacement in a different color so there is no yellowing problem to which they agree (they said they would make an “exception” for me). But then they ignore me for days. FedEx said that they received my package on Dec 9 but on Dec 19 Otterbox said that they dont have anything and they cannot track my package bc the tracking website didn’t work which of course it did. That was the last email I received from a human. On Dec 22 I received an automatically generated email that my package has been received (13 days after it actually arrived) and that was it. They have been ignoring my emails and not responding. $80 and a lot of my free time down the drain. I would not recommend doing business with them to anyone. I trusted their reputation and I should not have. This is the worst customer service experience i have ever had.",

    "reviewText": "Normally I'm pretty satisfied with my OtterBox purchases, but this one was a bit disappointing. Because the glitter case is clear, it's not made of a hard plastic like the others. For some reason I thought it would be a little harder but it's a flexible plastic. Also, as a side note, don't be dumb like me and use acetone or nail polish remover around this. I melted the side of it within the first couple of days of having it.",

    "reviewText": "The ASUS ROG Strix G16 is an absolute powerhouse and a dream machine for gamers and creators alike.Equipped with top-tier hardware, this laptop handles everything I throw at it effortlessly. Gaming is buttery smooth even with maxed-out settings, and multitasking is seamless thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM.The 16-inch screen with its high refresh rate is stunning. The colors are vibrant, the details are sharp, and the fluidity makes fast-paced games feel immersive and responsive.Sleek, modern, and undeniably ROG. The RGB keyboard is customizable and adds a premium feel, while the cooling system is highly effective and keeps the laptop running optimally even during long sessions.For a gaming laptop, the Strix G16 strikes a great balance between performance and portability. It’s lightweight enough to carry around without sacrificing the power you’d expect from a desktop replacement.While gaming laptops are known for short battery lives, the G16 pleasantly surprised me with its efficiency during non-gaming tasks.For the specs and performance this machine offers, it’s worth every penny. It’s an investment that will serve well for years to come.Whether you’re gaming, streaming, or editing, the ASUS ROG Strix G16 is a beast. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance laptop!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Deal! Great Gaming Laptop!",
    "reviewText": "I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16\" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",

The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",

I needed a block of knives that weren't good chef's knives but that we could use to film.They look GREAT on camera!!! Not the best for cooking if you're a chef but you already know that. They came sharp and even made the \"shink!\" sound when pulled out.If you actually care about good knives, get good knives. These are fine as a movie prop.",

Tienen muchísimo filo (tengan cuidado al lavarlos).* Material... Excelente calidad.* Peso... Muy buen peso. No son ligeros ni pesados en exceso... Se sienten de buena calidad y el peso ayuda a la buena manipulación.* Agarre: Bueno y cómodo.* Base: Funcional y de buena calidad.- CONCLUSIÓN: Muy buen producto por el precio (los compre durante Prime Day con muy buen descuento). Sin duda lo volvería a comprar incluso a precio regular.",

It easily connected to the filter system (Aquasana) without any additional hardware. To dispense the filtered water through the cross bar simply pull the lever straight down. The quality of the faucet is high end, heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way the black and brushed nickel finish goes with my countertop. I also love how firmly the nozzle retracts and stays up without sagging down.",

    "reviewText": "This item looks good, the 2-in-1 separate filter line is useful, and installation was straightforward.Unfortunately after 18 months, the faucet started leaking from inside the metal housing. Even when the faucet was turned off, water would leak slowly from inside the housing, down the line, and dripped over a few days. It ended up ruining my cabinet and the drywall on the ceiling of the floor below.The manufacturer, Kraus, claims a \"lifetime limited warranty\", but within the warranty text, the faucet hardware is only covered from defects for 1 year and 5 years, with more limits. After 1 year, they will also charge you for shipping the defective item back to them.I understand that I should have read the warranty terms in more detail before purchasing the item. However, I didn't expect a kitchen faucet to fail within such a short time frame, given how expensive it was. I also take issue with companies that try extract shipping fees from their customers when their products are defective and under warranty.Since I wasn't interested in paying for shipping to have a defective item repaired, and no longer trusted the manufacturer, I asked about return options. The agent condescendingly answered, \"honey, we're the manufacturer, you'll have to call Amazon about that\" and abruptly ended the conversation.I understand that defective items will occur from time to time. However, I do expect that companies stand by their products and provide support for their customers when it happens. Unfortunately Kraus is not one of those companies and I had to go through Amazon to get help with this situation.I'm sure most people who have bought this product have a faucet that's working fine. However, in the off chance that you get a defective unit, just know that Kraus will not be helpful. You're better off buying from another company for the same price range.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars You CANNOT go wrong with Vitamix!",
    "reviewText": "I'll cut to the chase for anyone who simply wants to know if Vitamix blenders are worth the investment. My answer is yes. Unequivocally.This is my second Vitamix. My first one (the 6300) is about 7 years old & STILL going strong, but I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new Ascent X4 because of the presets for many of the things I commonly blend. The 5 presets (smoothies, frozen desserts, soups, frozen cocktails, and last but not least, dips & spreads) take the guesswork out of which settings to use for many of the types of foods & beverages that I make on a regular basis.So far, I've used the presets on my Ascent X4 to blend smoothies & frappes and to clean my container when I've finished using it. (Btw, not that it was difficult to do this manually with my 6300, but I love the self-cleaning feature!) In addition, even though there's no preset for it on this model I was still able to make a great, super-smooth batch of almond butter with help from the \"dips and spreads\" setting, too!More things I love about the Ascent X series:- 10-year warranty -- almost unheard of these days- smart technology that tells me when I should use the tamper (if I'm not already using it)- clever tamper storage that conveniently fits on either side (I'll never need to hunt for it again!)- ability to blend manually without using a preset and includes a \"pulse\" feature- additional 15 seconds can be added with one touch on the \"15+\"- motorized base accepts all self-detect containers, including a food processor (I can hardly wait to get that one!)- container is dishwasher safe (it self-cleans exceptionally well but some might like this option)- easy to see when it's *powered on -- lights appear on the display, or off -- no lights (*Btw, the power button is hidden on the lower right side of the base beneath the edge. I say this because I had trouble finding it myself, lol.)I'll end with the fact that Vitamix stands 100% behind their products and the company has STELLAR customer service. If there's any issue with your blender or its components it's easy to contact them by phone. Not only do you get to talk with a real person, but those who answer calls are friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. I speak from experience.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Vitamix still king!",
    "reviewText": "I bought a Vitamix in 1999, and it's still going strong to this day. I have used and abused it over the years and it just keeps on going. I wanted to get a more modern version that has electronic optionsfor pre-programmed features like smoothies, etc. I have to admit that I was a little concerned that Vitamix would follow the trend of many popular, formerly high-quality brands by making products *look* better while lessening overall quality. I'm relieved to report that as far as I can tell, this machine is still a high quality machine that I would expect from Vitamix. The base and motor sounds feel and sound familiar... like an old friend. I love that even though there are pre-programmed functions, you still have the option to run the machine like an old Vitamix. That is, on/off and a dial to hone in on the perfect speed for what you're making. You can turn it on and go without having to navigate menus to find a \"manual\" mode. For professional chefs and experienced home cooks, this is important.The pre-programmed options are great. Combined with the extensive recipe book, you can make flawless recipes! If you're a beginner home cook, this machine could change your life.One thing I made all the time in my previous Vitamix is hummus, so that's the first thing I tried in the new one. And when I say I make hummus, I start by making tahini from sesame seeds and oil. The Vitamix handled this step flawlessly. In seconds, I had a beautiful tahini base for my hummus. Next I added chickpeas, lemon, salt and a bit of water. This Vitamix made a beautiful, super creamy and smooth hummus. I know some people like hummus that's a little rough, but I prefer a super smooth one and that's completely doable in this Vitamix.I was kind of hoping that in their years of R&D that they would have found a way to make it easier to get thick food like hummus out of the canister more easily, but that's a big ask. So I did have to use a spatula to get all the goodness out of the bottom.I have made some smoothies, mayo and potato soup -- all things my previous Vitamix did effortless, and this new model handles all these tasks without complaining. It truly is a beautiful machine and I'm really excited to keep using it and trying new things.My only concern for the future is the electronics side of things. I hope they engineered that as well as the motor and other physical aspects. With the old Vitamix, there are 2 switches and a dial. There's not much to go wrong as long the motor is working. And Vitamix makes powerful and quality motors, which is why my 25 year-old Vitamix shows no signs of slowing down today. Since I can't really test the electronics side of things, I'm really hoping they did put the R&D and build quality into that side of things as well.Overall, I'm super happy with this latest professional grade model and am so happy that Vitamix is still making high-quality and user-friendly products!",

Food gets very easily stuck, and is very difficult to clean out in the sink. Not sure if it’s dishwasher friendly, as I don’t have one.",

    "reviewText": "I have almost nothing to complain about with this kit. It cuts effortlessly compared to the cheaper one I used to have. Doesnt really matter what, onions, peppers, apples, carrots, potatoes, all of them go through it like a hot knife through butter. The ergonomics are great, I will say that I have yet to use the mandoline portion on top. Just haven't had a use case yet. But if the blades in that are as good as they are in the chopper, I don't doubt that it will have just as good as an experience. The storage for the blades is convenient and well thought out. I especially love the little comb that you can use to clean out the plate that pushes things through the blades. It makes cleaning up much easier than any previous chopper that I've used. My only real complaint about this is that the container that the chopped food enters is a bit too short. This both limits how much you can chop before having to empty the container, and it also prevents you from being able to fully close the chopper up with all the blades in their storage recepticles. Its a bit of a nitpick honestly. But it would be nice to have everything securely in one spot without having to worry about anything falling out if it gets tipped over.Other than that, great buy, highly recommend. Also I love the color!",

    "reviewText": "I got this dicer for 50% off, I think, paying only $30 or so for a normally $60 dicer. This is the first dicer that I have ever owned, although I have used a friend's dicer, and I will say that this cuts through about anything that you would need to dice in the kitchen. Like most dicers, stuff gets caught and stuck in the blades and the platform thingy, and it's a little hard to wash, especially because those blades are seriously sharp. An onion stands no chance against those blades. All of the different tools/slicers are really awesome and work really well for the most part.It isn't quite as big as what I thought it would be when I purchased it, and to give you an idea, most of the time I need to quarter an onion in order for it to be diced correctly and not smush out of the sides. If it's a small onion, you can fit half of it in the dicing area and get it done that way. I am extremely happy with the purchase overall, especially at that price, and it has taken away a lot of frustration and time when I cook. Next time, I will probably get one that's a little bigger, but this is most definitely a game changer by itself. Highly recommend this dicer. Just be careful with those blades! They are super sharp and got two of us bleeding within the first three or four days. Lol",

    "reviewText": "This is the lamest product design ever. It does not store easily as advertised because all the stuff that comes with it doesn't fit in it. Not even the manual! I couldn't even figure out how to get it back in the box it came in. So now I have to buy a box to put it all in, so I don't lose pieces and parts. Very, very, very disappointed. This problem could have been easily avoided with a better design for the product, or if they included a plastic box just big enough to store everything in.The cutting area is pretty small, so you have to cut your produce or whatever in half or so, so that it will fit on the cutting area and you can close the unit to do the cutting. Again, lame!!! Again, the problem could be easily avoided by making the product larger in general. That said, it does cut as advertised, at least with the \"garnish blade\".I bought this specifically for making Pico. That means using the small and maybe the large dicing blades. The goal was to have a quicker and easier way to do it, rather than using my big kitchenaid mixer with the food processing attachment. That device does a wonderful job by the way, but our kitchen is very small so my wife makes me store it in the basement. My goal with THIS product was to have something I could keep in the kitchen cabinet.I didn't have everything I needed to make pico tonight, so I used it to make fajitas. I cut onions and three different kinds of peppers with it. For the onion, I had to cut that in half to make it fit in the cutting area so it would cut. For the big bell peppers, I had to cut them in half, and then in half then other way. I really expected better.Overall, the plastic is decent quality for the purpose, as far as I can tell. It also cleaned up fairly easily.I can't comment on its various other functions yet, as I just got the thing yesterday! But that didn't stop Amazon from asking for a review, so here it is.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Stylish and Space-Saving: Why the CAROTE Non-Stick Cookware Set is My New Kitchen Essential",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently upgraded my kitchen with the CAROTE 11-piece Non-Stick Pots and Pans Set, and it's been a game-changer for my cooking routine. The cream white color gives my kitchen a clean, modern look, and the non-stick surface truly lives up to its claims. Food slides right off, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love that I can use less oil, and even delicate foods like eggs don’t stick, which makes every meal feel healthier and fresher.One of my favorite features is the removable handle, which is incredibly practical. It snaps on and off easily, so I can transfer pots from stovetop to oven or fridge without taking up extra space or needing separate storage for bulky handles. This space-saving design has been perfect for my small kitchen and would be amazing for anyone with limited storage or even an RV setup. Plus, the set is induction-compatible, which opens up a lot of versatility, especially if you have mixed appliances.Overall, this CAROTE cookware set has been an ideal addition to my kitchen. It's lightweight but durable, easy to clean, and does everything I need it to do, from stovetop to oven to fridge. It’s been a worthwhile investment, and I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. If you’re looking for a practical, stylish, and space-efficient cookware set, I highly recommend giving CAROTE a try!",

The removable handles are great and easy to apply and remove. The color is lovely, the little dots give it a little extra something that looks very nice. The fact that you can take them from stove to oven to the table and they still look cute it’s definitely a great extra. Heat distribution is amazing! Everything cooks very evenly! The stacking makes is easier to store and they are also super easy to clean.",

    "reviewText": "I love the nesting feature, but I am constantly worried about using a very high temperature while cooking. According to the instructions it strongly suggests to use a medium flame. Also, there is a weird grayish residue between washes on the bottom exterior of the pans. I think other than scratching each other that’s the reason for the felt dividers that came with the set. I feel like it should have one more large pot lid added so you can use multiple pots simultaneously. The cold storage lids don’t snap on, so they don’t feel secure when storing food in the fridge. Easy to clean both by hand and in a dishwasher.",

So far they seem to cook through very evenly they're heavy weight and easy to clean. They're very pretty looking and it's super convenient to have the handle store next to it. Also the lids are nice that they function is a cover and the whole pan and lid can be put into your refrigerator together or take into another person's house. It eliminates the need for Tupperware. For the price I have found these in extremely good buy and would recommend them to other people",

The nonstick coating is impressive – even with minimal oil, food slides right off without sticking. This makes cooking so much easier and clean-up even faster, as I can simply wipe the pans with a sponge and they’re good as new. Another thing I love is how evenly these pans heat up; whether I’m cooking vegetables or frying eggs, there are no hot spots, so everything cooks perfectly. The set feels durable and well-made, with comfortable handles that stay cool while cooking. Overall, this set is an excellent value for anyone looking for quality, user-friendly frying pans.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Initial Impression",
    "reviewText": "I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so \"skating\" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.",

    "reviewText": "We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next \"adventures in cooking\" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.UPDATE:First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking.- WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting.- NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability.- HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a \"plate\" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils..- STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment.Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both.Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY.",

    "reviewText": "These bowls and lids are great. I love the shredder and slicer and they clean up easily in the dishwasher. I recommend placing the lids on the top dishwasher rack to ensure the lids maintain their shape but even on the bottom they maintain their shape and seal if you place them on the bowls and leave them on for a while. The sizes allow you to measure, mix, and store right in the bowls. The silicone base is the best feature and provides a firm foundation as you mix vigorously. The extra measuring tools and silicone utensils are a nice bonus. Would buy again as a gift!",

    "reviewText": "I have a go-to set of mixing bowls that I love. But sometimes, especially during holidays and large cooking get togethers, I want to use a different set so I am not forced to wash and dry my set of 4 so often. So, in preparation for a large gathering weekend, I bought this set. I used many of the bowls and lids for the mass cooking adventure. I was pleased with the sizes and appearance of the bowls. I was able to use them for serving some dishes too. The lids worked well. I did not use the shredding feature so I cannot comment on that.I will note that the bowls are not thick or very sturdy. I hand washed all pieces so that they would not be warped. I saw in other comments that the kids warped over time. By hand washing, I suspect that won’t happen to mine. They are not thick, I emphasize. I do not plan to use these as my sturdy, everyday pieces but they will serve well as my secondary set. The metal is shiny but I suspect it will dull and scratch over time but that is just aesthetics. I love the bottoms as they do not move when mixing. For the money, this is a great set of bowls. I would not use them daily but I recommend them for back up prep and storing.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars How to Care for a Damascus Knife",
    "reviewText": "I seen a few negative reviews about rust, FYI moisture is the worst enemy to this type of steel.Here is how to care for your Damascus Blade. I collect Katanas, which are all Hand Forged blades.FYI: the picture of knife darkens the blade so you can see the Design.When heat treated and used in a blade this combination holds an excellent edge. The blade will gain an attractive patina with prolonged use as with any Carbon steel based blade. The colour and character of the patina is determined by the type of ingredients and food the blade is used to cut. For example, cooked red meat creates a beautiful blue-grey patina that will be familiar to anyone who has encountered heirloom carving knives.Caring for your blade:Caring for a Damascus steel blade is much the same as for a Carbon steel blade - moisture is the enemy. Once the blade has built up a patina it is much more forgiving, but a fresh Carbon steel based blade will begin to rust in a heartbeat.Never, ever: NEVER!Leave the blade resting in standing waterRest the blade on a damp tea towel, wash cloth, etcStore in direct contact with leatherWash in a dishwasherTo help your Damascus steel knife become a heirloom, there are only a few things you need to do.After use:Rinse clean under running water and wipe dry with a clean clothLightly oil using food safe oilStore in a dry placeWhile your blade is still developing a patina, it is a good idea to quickly wipe the blade down before moving on to a food preparation task not involving the knife.Oiling - (I use Japanese Sword Choji Oil)- https://www.amazon.com/The-Institute-of-Asian-Arts/dp/B0061LS2SY?th=1&psc=1A common mistake when oiling a blade is to use something like olive oil that will go rancid. I recommend Choji oil, as it is food safe, cheap, and readily available.WashingMany people new to Damascus steel knives approach washing their blades with trepidation. Cleaning your knife is straightforward: rinse it under running water, give it a wipe with a lightly soapy dish sponge, rinse it again and wipe dry. If you’re familiar with the term “Bachelor Wash” (or can decipher the connotation), this is all it takes.Refreshing the patternThe Damascus pattern will fade with use - this is normal and easy to rectify. Hot black instant coffee (cheap, nasty, and mixed at a ratio that would kill a large animal) is a mild etchant that is used as the final stage of the Damascus etching process. It is element of process that contributes most to the blackness of the pattern.Here’s how to refresh your own blades:Brew a batch of the cheapest and nastiest black instant coffee you can get your hands on. You’ll need enough to immerse the blade in.Wash the blade, then thoroughly wipe it down with methylated spirits to remove oils and contaminantsImmerse the blade in the instant coffee, heating the coffee back up if it’s gone cold (heat increases the rate of reaction). Take care to avoid getting coffee on the handle.Expect the process to take anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour. Check the blade every 15 minutes by removing it from the coffee and allowing the coffee to drip off. Do not touch or wipe down the blade at any point.When the desired results have been achieved, remove the blade from the coffee then wash as normal before oiling and storing.",

    "reviewTitle": "BEYOND SHARP!",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The best part is the smooth gliding RAZOR edge this knife has out of the box. It's a Chinese made VG-10 steel, damascus style (I can't verify how many layers this really has), but VG-10 steel has a great reputation. The knife shipped OVERNIGHT and by coincidence, I bought fresh Walleye AKA Pickerel today at the grocery store. I've used a survival knife to do this before, but it left way too much meat on the skin. This knife just slid right through. If you're OK buying a knife made in China, I'd pick one of these up. The hype is real.Downsides:1) Nobody can really say if this is damascus or just damascus style, nor have I used it for more than one task, but without seeing the manufacture process, it may or may not be.Fun facts:The VG10 steel is native to Japan. 9CRMOV10 or whatever the top rated Japanese knives are made of is a Chinese steel, copying the VG10. How can a genuine Japanese chef knife (like most of the top rated ones) be made out of a Chinese composition steel, yet still be Japanese? This Japanese STYLE chef knife is made from higher grade steel than any of the Chinese 9CRMOV10ABC steel used in most top rated competitors and it's cheaper.Good stuff gets made in China, and so does junk. For the price point, VG-10 steel and quality so far, I'd have to say this is an excellent knife and not junk.Update Several months later: I can still shave with the blade. To be safe and remove any micro burrs, I dragged it through a ceramic v shaped sharpener for three passes, applying no pressure other than the weight of the knife. The blade is still scalpel sharp and glides through EVERYTHING. USE A WOODEN CUTTING BOARD! ANY blade will eventually suffer damage if it's slammed into a glass cutting board or countertop enough times. I didn't HAVE to use the ceramic either. Removing any micro abrasions from any blade helps them stay sharp, but not essential for this knife. It stayed razor sharp on it's own, so I take good care of it.The hamon line on the edge and damascus pattern in the blade are incredible! From one steel worker to another: great job! Worth EVERY PENNY!",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Accurate and Reliable with Convenient Features: Amazon Basics Digital Kitchen Scale",
    "reviewText": "The Amazon Basics Digital Kitchen Scale is a practical and efficient tool for both everyday cooking and precise food measurement.

The glass platform is not only stylish but also easy to clean, adding to its convenience. The compact size ensures it doesn’t take up too much counter space, and it’s lightweight enough to be easily stored when not in use.Functionality: One of the standout features is the tare function, which allows you to subtract the weight of containers or packaging to measure only the ingredients. This is especially useful for baking or when dealing with multiple ingredients. The scale offers measurements in various units, including ounces, pounds, grams, and kilograms, making it versatile for different recipes and dietary needs.Accuracy and Performance: The accuracy of the scale is commendable, providing precise measurements that are essential for cooking and baking.

The scale also has an auto-off feature to conserve battery life, which kicks in after a period of inactivity.Minor Drawbacks: While the scale generally performs well, there are a few minor considerations. The glass surface, though easy to clean, can be prone to fingerprints and smudges, which may require frequent wiping. Additionally, the scale’s accuracy may slightly vary with very small measurements, though this is common with many digital scales.Overall Impression: The Amazon Basics Digital Kitchen Scale offers excellent value for its price, combining accuracy, functionality, and ease of use. Its sleek design, versatility, and practical features make it a great addition to any kitchen. With just a few minor areas for improvement, it stands out as a reliable and efficient tool for a range of culinary needs.",

    "reviewText": "Scissors are nice quality and do well cutting but have limited use due to difficulty of cleaning. These have limited applications because they don’t come apart for thorough cleaning. Any raw meat packaging or uncooked items that can easily transmit bacteria should be avoided as the bacteria can get trapped where shears are joined. Soaking or dishwasher cleaning ultimately results in rust as water cannot be totally dried. Because of this , they’re not truly all purpose and I will need to invest in another pair that can come apart.",

Good memories!I did have the wattage meter to check the status. On idle it’s 0.2W. On bake it’s ~1,300-1,500W (same as a bedroom space heater). This thing is pretty cool. Toast really well. Got it on sale at $150 during the Amazon Day once a quarter of something. Has been on my wish list for a bit until recently. This thing with right out of the box. Relatively minimal noise level. Can replace the oven, air fryer, and toaster to reduce Valuable countertop real estate. The oven is basically another storage cabinet. Definitely recommend!",

Even though it cooks food quick, I am still able to smell the food around the house. I only wish there was a storage drawer for all the pieces that come with it.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My Instant Vortex died just short of 4 years. I opened it up and reset the thermal \"fuse\". It worked but only for about a minute, giving me the E1 error code. Time for an upgrade. The non-stick trays are also in a sorry state.This upgrade is worth it if only for the exterior stainless steel and the cute French door. Air fryers that open the door down always bugged me. Why can't they have a door like the microwave? Everything drips on the door hinge and the door. I had to get another tray to put on top of the opened door as another drip tray. But when I detached the door of the Instant Vortex, there wasn't much grease dirt accumulated there.The door isn't just cute but fully functional. You can open it with one hand, doesn't matter if you are left or right-handed. You need a little bit of clearance on the sides for it to stay open because it's spring-operated.The interface and buttons are superior. There are only 6 buttons including start and cancel. Others control what the dial is used for, setting time, temperature, cooking mode, etc. The buttons are quality sensor buttons with no moving parts. The rubbery membrane buttons are always the first thing to go in any appliance. The little display manages to tell you if you have a preheat mode and where to put your trays.The basket and rack are quality stainless steel. A short time will tell if they are not. The trays look like aluminum which most baking trays are made of. The grill plate is solid steel with ceramic coating. Many will not buy telfon like non-stick utensils. Many will not buy stainless steel utensils. I'm going for all stainless steel in the kitchen. They are easily cleaned by boiling in water with some washing soda. It's effortless to maintain even a mirror finish.Even the tray handle makes a lot of sense. You don't have one for the Instant Vortex. The rotating mechanism is also all metal.My only hesitation is that it doesn't have a rotating basket. My last use of the Instant Vortes was to roast peanuts, overheating in the process. Since this fryer is much bigger, you can spread the same amount of peanut on the flat basket in one layer. An air fryer is supposed to fry evenly.The Instant Vortex basket can be modified to fit the new host. Unscrew the black supporting blocks for the old rotisserie bars. All you need is a thick drill bit to grind off the rivet holding the old rotisserie bars, take them off, and enlarge the resulting hole a little. Screw the supporting blocks back. The new rotisserie can be put through the holed at the two ends.",

    "reviewText": "This thing can literally do everything... even \"hardboil\" eggs! I purchased specifically for the air frying and because a frozen pizza can be easily cooked in it, but I am amazed by everything that it can do - and how well it does it! The pizzas turn out great and it's easy for even my teenagers to use it when they get hungry. While it can fit a full frozen pizza, I don't feel like it takes as much counter space as some other comparable units (Looking at you, Breville). It's easy to clean. I usually just line the bottom tray of the unit with aluminum foil to make it lickety split. Really glad that I purchased it - it does make dinner a breeze and saves me from having to turn on and heat up a big oven if I'm just feeding myself.",

The air fryer is wonderful for those frozen items and potatoes and the rotisserie works a treat. I’ve used it for baking as well, though I have had adjust cooking times. It will overcook if I follow the instructions on the packet. It is easy to clean and looks aesthetically pleasing in my kitchen. Highly recommend.",

Be careful not to burn yourself. I think it will last longer as a result though. And it works great.My model came with the grilling plate and I love it.The drip tray is removable and catches crumbs well, but to help keep the inside clean for many types of cooking, I also recommend getting third party stainless steel 12.5x9.5 inch baking pans that come with raised baking grills. It will let the air fryer circulate while catching more significant amounts of sauce and greasy drips.",

    "reviewText": "This quilt is not very thick nor is the nap very thick. It definitely has a nap, but it is very low and doesn’t dramatically change color when you smooth it against the grain. The loden color I picked is dark enough to pair with my purple throw pillows as my other comforters are dark purple. Because it is not very thick, it lays flat and offers a clean look on the bed. The shams are simple without frilly edges, but I like the look. The quilt is very thin; it does not really feel as if it is filled with anything, but it has a lot of weight to it so that it is sufficient for winter use. The California King size has plenty of length and width to cover my bed and even the top of my bed skirt - please note this quilt does not come with a matching bed skirt - so it looks smooth and finished when the bed is made. I do wish this set came in a dark purple and not the lavender they offer as I’d get that color in a heartbeat as I prefer this thinner but still heavy style of bed covering. I also like that it is basically the same on both sides so that you can reverse it and it won’t look “wrong”. And the fact that it can be machine washed and dried makes it a good option for someone looking for a flatter, less puffy look for their bed. My only gripe is that it wrinkles a bit.",

The quilt and matching pillow shams are well-made and durable, promising to last through many washes without losing their softness.Overall, this quilt set is a fantastic addition to any bedroom.

The two-wick candle burns evenly across the top. To ensure this, on the first burn, allow the candle wax to liquify across the entire surface. Don’t extinguish it before that, otherwise you’ll never get an even burn.Trim wicks before each new burn & always burn long enough to liquify the entire surface. You’ll never have puddle burns, again.The fragrance of this candle is like a nice forest of fresh fir trees. 🌲 It’s not too strong, but just right.This candle is unbeatable for the Christmas season.",

Overall not a big deal. Very happy with my purchase, I only wish I could buy more!",

Bright enough where I can sit in the office comfortably at night without the need of turning on the room lights. These also help with out with eye strain too that I’ve noticed when using the computer for long periods of time.Getting them up and running was a breeze and it also works just as well with Alexa assistant. Plenty of preset color options to choose from or you can make your own through the Govee App.Only reason I docked a point is because the double sided adhesive strips provided with the panels are abysmal. They lasted for a day before they started falling off the wall one by one. Had to order some 3M mounting tape to get these to stick so fair warning there.Overall I’m pleased with these and many other Govee products. Way more affordable solution compared to the other alternatives. I’d definitely recommend these.",

    "reviewText": "I cannot stress this enough. Please do yourself a favor and watch the instructional video before you attempt to assemble them lol. These lights are better than the nanoleaf lights I bought prior, I can light each panel a separate color and the app made designing a layout a breeze. My only complaint would be the panels are a bit too tight in the wall mount, so it pulled the adhesive right off the wall (along with some paint and a portion of the drywall). This, of course, could have been avoided if I had taken my own advice and watched the instructional video before assembling. The panels are slightly smaller than the nanoleaf brand, so I was able to fit a bigger design on my small space that I wasn't able to do with the nanoleaf panels.",

    "reviewText": "***UPDATE: I was blown away by the Govee customer support after reaching out to them explaining the issue. They were extremely quick to respond (within about an hour) to my inquiry and immediately took steps to rectify my problem. They sent me a replacement that arrived in less than 48 hours, and the adhesive on this batch seems much better after setting them up. I was extremely impressed with the customer service and as I stated in my original review, the actual lights are beautiful. This has made me confident to continue purchasing and recommending Govee's products to friends and family.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I hate to write this review, as I love all of my other Govee products, but this really was a disappointing purchase. I have bought near $1000 of Govee lights over the past couple months and this is the first one that really was a terrible experience.As for the lights themselves, they are absolutely gorgeous. And the actual instructions for setup were fairly easy so no problems there. But oh god, the adhesion I would give a 0/10 if I could. I spent about an hour perfectly planning out my design, measuring for perfect placement, and very meticulously leveling each light panel as I followed the instructions on sticking them to the wall. In the morning I carefully cleaned the wall with isopropyl alcohol just to make sure there was no residue on the walls, then in the evening when it was time to actually install the hexa lights, I followed the instructions and wiped the wall with a dry cloth and then for each light I applied pressure for 60 seconds just to be safe. As I finished getting all the panels up and calibrated, one of the hex lights came unstuck. I wiped the wall again where that specific one fell off, reattached it, and went to sleep. Overnight, 2 of the 10 lights fell off the wall and were disconnected. 3 of the remaining 8 on the wall were not attached, but were just hanging from the support of some of the other lights.This whole installation has been a disaster from the start and has been an horrible user experience, which is a shame because the light quality for these themselves are great. So now I have to make the decision if I need to go and pay out of pocket to buy a bunch of command strips and reinstall all of these completely over again, or I am going to return them. I still haven't decided, but I wanted to provide this as a warning to all others looking to purchase this particular light.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. One of my favorite products, the size and quality is solid. The mounting and serting of your design is much simpler than what I saw through the videos. The configuration is pretty quick. Just have a cleR design on mind or lay them on the carpet and play around until you get the right configuration for you. The colors are super and the panels are Super Super bright. On the pictures and video they were set at less than 5% because otherwize the reflect of the light doesnt allow you to take a clear picture or video.My only call out is that you will have extra \" cable\" between each panel connection as expected so you can have wiggle room, however the panels aren't heavy and the adhesive is pretty averga so depsite that I did spent 30 second pressing each one, as requested in the instructions. However, after a day or two de bending extra cord hidden in the back and the \"average\" adhesive, does not held the hexagons in place. them very well so it end up adding an extra double sided tape so they could stick nicely.Love the quality, size, functionalities,and price its a great product! Go grab yours!",

    "reviewText": "PRO's: Absolutely awesome, so many different configurations and boy do they ever get bright,, so much so that I have to keep them turned down to 20% at the highest, mind you my whole room is full of different Govee lighting on every wall.Super easy to use from the app with so many different colour patterns to choose from who of course you can DIY and works with T1 and T2 display systems, are RGBIC so you can get pure white out of them up to 6500 K or down to around 3000 I believe.Super easy doing install and comes with many suggestions on patterns or of course you can choose your own, so many options with the assignable LEDs inside each hex, let alone the combination of them working in harmony. Great value as they often go on sale for 40% off or so and are much better value than Phillips lighting without trading off any quality, in fact in my opinion it's superior in most cases.CON's: (TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE)",

I placed this on my entryway bench and when you sit to put on shoes or you're getting the dogs collars and leashes ready, it gives off a pleasant smell. But it's not so strong that I smell it all the time or can't burn a candle in the living room without the smells competing. I will likely purchase another one, maybe 2, for other small spaces in the house. Great value, too, since you get the extra fragrance bottle.",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Reed Diffuser Set (Starshine1), and I’m really enjoying the fresh, pleasant scent it adds to my home. The fragrance is light and uplifting, with a nice balance that isn’t overpowering — it creates a calming atmosphere whether in the living room, bedroom, or even the bathroom. It’s the perfect scent for daily use and definitely enhances the ambiance in any room.The design of the diffuser itself is lovely and fits well with my home decor. I also appreciate the rattan reeds, which are stylish and functional. The aromatherapy effect is subtle yet effective, making it perfect for spaces where you want a gentle, consistent fragrance without it being too strong.My only minor critique is that I wish the scent-drawing straws (the reeds) were a bit larger. I’ve noticed that the scent doesn’t seem to diffuse as strongly as I expected, and I think larger reeds would help draw the fragrance out more effectively and fill the room with a more noticeable aroma. That said, it still works well for a more subtle scent and is a great option if you prefer a lighter fragrance.Overall, this is a lovely diffuser set with a great fragrance, and it’s a perfect decorative gift as well. I just wish the reeds were slightly thicker for better scent diffusion. Still, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a nice, relaxing room scent.",

    "reviewText": "This Gonjahon Reed Diffuser Set is a pleasant-smelling reed diffuser with a whole lot of essential oil. There is a main glass bottle which apparently has about 112ml of essential oil and a plastic refill bottle with 200ml more for a total of 10.55 fluid ounces of essential oil. The sales listing mentions the essential oil should last about 120 days or 4 months. And the set comes with 10 black reeds or “rattan diffusion bars.” The smell reminds me of a gentle cologne which apparently is labeled as “early morning.”There is not much for instructions. The box shows removing the reeds and flipping them apparently every 48hours. But beyond that, there is nothing more except for a lot of Chinese Kanji.This is a good essential reed diffuser set. And the glass bottle is elegant enough to place out in the open for guests to admire. As to whether this would turn out to be your favorite fragrance, that is hard to predict since everyone’s taste is different. But it is a gentle, pleasant scent that most people would likely enjoy.",

The concept is smart but they needed to add possibly another bar within the shelf to actually support better. Limited use for shelf because when adding additional items the shelf starts to lower in front part and looks like items will fall off and it’s not flush against the wall. I expected more considering price. Very cute design and great if hanging lighter items then books or albums. Great if for Knick knacks. Would not repurchase for my intended use.",

    "reviewText": "Instructions were clear, and it was nice that it specified the size of drill bits needed. But with the included hardware there is quite a bit of vertical flex to the bracket once mounted as it comes with countersunk screws which the bracket wasn't made for. After finding one of my shelves in particular was too saggy, I bought new screws with wide flat heads (see picture) and they are much more secure.It would also be nice if there was an included way to secure the shelf on the bracket - it just slides on and off. I'm considering whether I want to glue it, or perhaps inset a neodymium magnet on the shelf back so it would hold to the bracket.",

    "reviewText": "We absolutely LOVE this candle warmer that we got for our housewarming present! It's so much safer than burning candles and in my opinion, the scent stays longer and steadier than a live flame. And while it might not be as cozy as a flickering flame, it is so much safer for our home. We have a child who always has friends over, and the candle is always a concern - we don't want kids burning themselves, and now we don't have to worry about it. The candle warmer escapes notice. I did notice this size of candle warmer works best with single wick candles or smaller candles - I think I would need a bigger one for three wick candles, but that's fine. I think this also helps the candle last longer as well!",

I was looking for a way to help reduce some unpleasant scents in my office at work (joys of being located near a loading dock in a large city) and I didn’t feel comfortable with an open flame because I often have to leave my office to address issues in other departments. I love that this gives me a safe way to use my candle stash and that it does so in such a pretty way! People stop in to comment on the great smell from the candles it melts and ask me where I got this great little lamp. I also love the timer feature because if I forget to turn it off before I leave for the night, I know it will shut off on its own!I love that this lamp has an adjustable height to work with any size candle and that it helps my candles last longer than traditional burning! 10/10 on all fronts!",

The clips are mounted to a singular plate that fits behind the baskets and really provides support. Due to the design, the clips all contact the baskets evenly and spread the weight all the way across. It took longer to prep the surface than it did to install the baskets. Start to finish install was under 5 min total and they have held up perfectly.",

    "reviewText": "The only negative I have is, if you've got an apartment sized tub/shower these might be too wide and you'll end up bumping into them with elbows or any body part that's aligned with where you've installed them. However, that's not a design flaw, therefore I didn't take away any stars. They seem to be very sturdy and has great stickiness (I did thoroughly clean the shower walls, rinsed them well, then wiped the areas I was placing the hangers with alcohol. Then I heated the hangers with my blow dryer, used a butter knife to make sure I got around every edge. Then I waited a full 24+ hours to attach the baskets and put items in them. I have huge salon sized shampoo and conditioner bottles with pumps that withhold their weight and me pumping to get the product. I really REALLY want to love these, but having to contort my body every shower is annoying. I will see if they have replacement sticky adhesives and if changing positions would work (shower walls have 2 \"seams\" that stick out, so I don't have unlimited space).",

    "reviewText": "We just renovated our tub/shower surround and it didn't come with shelves, so we needed a solution - hence this purchase. I used a level and frog tape to get these exactly where I wanted them, then lifted the clear panel up and carefully removed the backing, keeping the frog tape on as a guide. Pressed down firmly, then let the adhesive cure overnight before putting the shelves up. It feels like these aren't going anywhere. The install was so easy and perfect. They hold a ton of weight and feel very sturdy. The instructions say warranty is 2 years, so that's encouraging! I will report back if they fail.",

They offer the ambiance of real candles without the worry of an open flame, making them perfect for households with children or pets, or for anyone who wants to enjoy candlelight without the fire hazard. The flickering flame effect is incredibly convincing, mimicking the gentle dance of a real candle flame. This creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. They are made of real wax which enhances the realistic look and feel. The timer function adds convenience, allowing you to set the candles to turn on and off automatically at your preferred times. The remote control makes it easy to operate them from a distance, even across the room. No more worries about accidentally knocking over a candle or leaving it unattended. These flameless candles offer the perfect blend of beauty, functionality, and peace of mind. Highly reccomended!",

    "reviewText": "This is beautiful and so well made and the detail is amazing .It looks so great, and when it’s lit up it just gets better .Took its first good hard rain today and it didn’t bother it at all. Nothing came off in the storm and I couldn't be happier .Being solar powered is the way to go!My backyard is lit up like a Christmas tree, all solar powered .Im looking forward to buying many more of these from this company. I already have my next one picked out. So beautiful, well made and solar, what more could you want. It comes so well packaged and it looks gorgeous from the time you start opening it.You can really see all the care and attention that’s put into these beautiful statues.I will be getting the rest of the collection, I can hardly wait.I have had so many compliments on this beauty and the price is so reasonable.I’m in love with these and look forward to soooo many more 😊Thanks for making such a gorgeous piece of art!",
