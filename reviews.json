    "reviewText": "I love this phone case. It’s not bulk or slippery and I love the shimmer. I also use a metal magnetic mag safe pop socket and it sticks amazingly. I’ve dropped my phone several times with this case on and it protects it. Otter box is great! I just bought a new one to replace my old one, which was about a year and a half old. They last a long time but it will yellow over time. I recommend replacing once a year to keep it looking clear and pretty.",

    "reviewText": "I love this case! I had recently cracked the entire back of my phone due to having a non- protective case on it. I ordered this otter box because it’s cute but also provides protection. It fits my phone perfectly and is very comfortable to hold. It has protected the camera in the back and is very durable - I don’t even have a scratch on it yet!",

    "reviewText": "I’ve been through a few phone cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and haven’t found one that fits it well (particularly around the rear facing camera)…until now! I don’t understand how so many different cases don’t fit something as popular as an iPhone (especially in the exact same place and way). The magnet is the right amount of strength too, not at all weak so holds on to my car mount, but easy to remove if you are intentionally trying to remove it from a mount or charger.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Bad quality case and the worst customer support of my life",
    "reviewText": "The case was very nice for a week or two and then stretched so bad that my phones corners were constantly popping out of it. I had to pop the phone back into the case every time i took the phone out of my pocket. Also the more rubbery part of the case (the sides that stretched) yellowed a lot after just a couple of weeks of use. Could not return it to Amazon bc i didnt have the original box so I submitted a warranty claim on the Otterbox website. They asked for photos and said that my case might qualify for a replacement and i need to ship it back to them. They said that they couldn’t provide a shipping label but my shipping fee will be waived on their side. Liars. So i go and spend $30 on shipping it back, send them the receipt and they say they are not going to reimburse it now. Would not even give me a gift card for that amount. So i end up spending $80 on a bad quality product that i dont even have anymore. I ask them if they can at least send me a replacement in a different color so there is no yellowing problem to which they agree (they said they would make an “exception” for me). But then they ignore me for days. FedEx said that they received my package on Dec 9 but on Dec 19 Otterbox said that they dont have anything and they cannot track my package bc the tracking website didn’t work which of course it did. That was the last email I received from a human. On Dec 22 I received an automatically generated email that my package has been received (13 days after it actually arrived) and that was it. They have been ignoring my emails and not responding. $80 and a lot of my free time down the drain. I would not recommend doing business with them to anyone. I trusted their reputation and I should not have. This is the worst customer service experience i have ever had.",

    "reviewText": "Normally I'm pretty satisfied with my OtterBox purchases, but this one was a bit disappointing. Because the glitter case is clear, it's not made of a hard plastic like the others. For some reason I thought it would be a little harder but it's a flexible plastic. Also, as a side note, don't be dumb like me and use acetone or nail polish remover around this. I melted the side of it within the first couple of days of having it.",

    "reviewText": "The ASUS ROG Strix G16 is an absolute powerhouse and a dream machine for gamers and creators alike.Equipped with top-tier hardware, this laptop handles everything I throw at it effortlessly. Gaming is buttery smooth even with maxed-out settings, and multitasking is seamless thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM.The 16-inch screen with its high refresh rate is stunning. The colors are vibrant, the details are sharp, and the fluidity makes fast-paced games feel immersive and responsive.Sleek, modern, and undeniably ROG. The RGB keyboard is customizable and adds a premium feel, while the cooling system is highly effective and keeps the laptop running optimally even during long sessions.For a gaming laptop, the Strix G16 strikes a great balance between performance and portability. It’s lightweight enough to carry around without sacrificing the power you’d expect from a desktop replacement.While gaming laptops are known for short battery lives, the G16 pleasantly surprised me with its efficiency during non-gaming tasks.For the specs and performance this machine offers, it’s worth every penny. It’s an investment that will serve well for years to come.Whether you’re gaming, streaming, or editing, the ASUS ROG Strix G16 is a beast. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance laptop!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Deal! Great Gaming Laptop!",
    "reviewText": "I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16\" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",

The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",

I needed a block of knives that weren't good chef's knives but that we could use to film.They look GREAT on camera!!! Not the best for cooking if you're a chef but you already know that. They came sharp and even made the \"shink!\" sound when pulled out.If you actually care about good knives, get good knives. These are fine as a movie prop.",

Tienen muchísimo filo (tengan cuidado al lavarlos).* Material... Excelente calidad.* Peso... Muy buen peso. No son ligeros ni pesados en exceso... Se sienten de buena calidad y el peso ayuda a la buena manipulación.* Agarre: Bueno y cómodo.* Base: Funcional y de buena calidad.- CONCLUSIÓN: Muy buen producto por el precio (los compre durante Prime Day con muy buen descuento). Sin duda lo volvería a comprar incluso a precio regular.",

It easily connected to the filter system (Aquasana) without any additional hardware. To dispense the filtered water through the cross bar simply pull the lever straight down. The quality of the faucet is high end, heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way the black and brushed nickel finish goes with my countertop. I also love how firmly the nozzle retracts and stays up without sagging down.",

    "reviewText": "This item looks good, the 2-in-1 separate filter line is useful, and installation was straightforward.Unfortunately after 18 months, the faucet started leaking from inside the metal housing. Even when the faucet was turned off, water would leak slowly from inside the housing, down the line, and dripped over a few days. It ended up ruining my cabinet and the drywall on the ceiling of the floor below.The manufacturer, Kraus, claims a \"lifetime limited warranty\", but within the warranty text, the faucet hardware is only covered from defects for 1 year and 5 years, with more limits. After 1 year, they will also charge you for shipping the defective item back to them.I understand that I should have read the warranty terms in more detail before purchasing the item. However, I didn't expect a kitchen faucet to fail within such a short time frame, given how expensive it was. I also take issue with companies that try extract shipping fees from their customers when their products are defective and under warranty.Since I wasn't interested in paying for shipping to have a defective item repaired, and no longer trusted the manufacturer, I asked about return options. The agent condescendingly answered, \"honey, we're the manufacturer, you'll have to call Amazon about that\" and abruptly ended the conversation.I understand that defective items will occur from time to time. However, I do expect that companies stand by their products and provide support for their customers when it happens. Unfortunately Kraus is not one of those companies and I had to go through Amazon to get help with this situation.I'm sure most people who have bought this product have a faucet that's working fine. However, in the off chance that you get a defective unit, just know that Kraus will not be helpful. You're better off buying from another company for the same price range.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars You CANNOT go wrong with Vitamix!",
    "reviewText": "I'll cut to the chase for anyone who simply wants to know if Vitamix blenders are worth the investment. My answer is yes. Unequivocally.This is my second Vitamix. My first one (the 6300) is about 7 years old & STILL going strong, but I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new Ascent X4 because of the presets for many of the things I commonly blend. The 5 presets (smoothies, frozen desserts, soups, frozen cocktails, and last but not least, dips & spreads) take the guesswork out of which settings to use for many of the types of foods & beverages that I make on a regular basis.So far, I've used the presets on my Ascent X4 to blend smoothies & frappes and to clean my container when I've finished using it. (Btw, not that it was difficult to do this manually with my 6300, but I love the self-cleaning feature!) In addition, even though there's no preset for it on this model I was still able to make a great, super-smooth batch of almond butter with help from the \"dips and spreads\" setting, too!More things I love about the Ascent X series:- 10-year warranty -- almost unheard of these days- smart technology that tells me when I should use the tamper (if I'm not already using it)- clever tamper storage that conveniently fits on either side (I'll never need to hunt for it again!)- ability to blend manually without using a preset and includes a \"pulse\" feature- additional 15 seconds can be added with one touch on the \"15+\"- motorized base accepts all self-detect containers, including a food processor (I can hardly wait to get that one!)- container is dishwasher safe (it self-cleans exceptionally well but some might like this option)- easy to see when it's *powered on -- lights appear on the display, or off -- no lights (*Btw, the power button is hidden on the lower right side of the base beneath the edge. I say this because I had trouble finding it myself, lol.)I'll end with the fact that Vitamix stands 100% behind their products and the company has STELLAR customer service. If there's any issue with your blender or its components it's easy to contact them by phone. Not only do you get to talk with a real person, but those who answer calls are friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. I speak from experience.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Vitamix still king!",
    "reviewText": "I bought a Vitamix in 1999, and it's still going strong to this day. I have used and abused it over the years and it just keeps on going. I wanted to get a more modern version that has electronic optionsfor pre-programmed features like smoothies, etc. I have to admit that I was a little concerned that Vitamix would follow the trend of many popular, formerly high-quality brands by making products *look* better while lessening overall quality. I'm relieved to report that as far as I can tell, this machine is still a high quality machine that I would expect from Vitamix. The base and motor sounds feel and sound familiar... like an old friend. I love that even though there are pre-programmed functions, you still have the option to run the machine like an old Vitamix. That is, on/off and a dial to hone in on the perfect speed for what you're making. You can turn it on and go without having to navigate menus to find a \"manual\" mode. For professional chefs and experienced home cooks, this is important.The pre-programmed options are great. Combined with the extensive recipe book, you can make flawless recipes! If you're a beginner home cook, this machine could change your life.One thing I made all the time in my previous Vitamix is hummus, so that's the first thing I tried in the new one. And when I say I make hummus, I start by making tahini from sesame seeds and oil. The Vitamix handled this step flawlessly. In seconds, I had a beautiful tahini base for my hummus. Next I added chickpeas, lemon, salt and a bit of water. This Vitamix made a beautiful, super creamy and smooth hummus. I know some people like hummus that's a little rough, but I prefer a super smooth one and that's completely doable in this Vitamix.I was kind of hoping that in their years of R&D that they would have found a way to make it easier to get thick food like hummus out of the canister more easily, but that's a big ask. So I did have to use a spatula to get all the goodness out of the bottom.I have made some smoothies, mayo and potato soup -- all things my previous Vitamix did effortless, and this new model handles all these tasks without complaining. It truly is a beautiful machine and I'm really excited to keep using it and trying new things.My only concern for the future is the electronics side of things. I hope they engineered that as well as the motor and other physical aspects. With the old Vitamix, there are 2 switches and a dial. There's not much to go wrong as long the motor is working. And Vitamix makes powerful and quality motors, which is why my 25 year-old Vitamix shows no signs of slowing down today. Since I can't really test the electronics side of things, I'm really hoping they did put the R&D and build quality into that side of things as well.Overall, I'm super happy with this latest professional grade model and am so happy that Vitamix is still making high-quality and user-friendly products!",

Food gets very easily stuck, and is very difficult to clean out in the sink. Not sure if it’s dishwasher friendly, as I don’t have one.",

    "reviewText": "I have almost nothing to complain about with this kit. It cuts effortlessly compared to the cheaper one I used to have. Doesnt really matter what, onions, peppers, apples, carrots, potatoes, all of them go through it like a hot knife through butter. The ergonomics are great, I will say that I have yet to use the mandoline portion on top. Just haven't had a use case yet. But if the blades in that are as good as they are in the chopper, I don't doubt that it will have just as good as an experience. The storage for the blades is convenient and well thought out. I especially love the little comb that you can use to clean out the plate that pushes things through the blades. It makes cleaning up much easier than any previous chopper that I've used. My only real complaint about this is that the container that the chopped food enters is a bit too short. This both limits how much you can chop before having to empty the container, and it also prevents you from being able to fully close the chopper up with all the blades in their storage recepticles. Its a bit of a nitpick honestly. But it would be nice to have everything securely in one spot without having to worry about anything falling out if it gets tipped over.Other than that, great buy, highly recommend. Also I love the color!",

    "reviewText": "I got this dicer for 50% off, I think, paying only $30 or so for a normally $60 dicer. This is the first dicer that I have ever owned, although I have used a friend's dicer, and I will say that this cuts through about anything that you would need to dice in the kitchen. Like most dicers, stuff gets caught and stuck in the blades and the platform thingy, and it's a little hard to wash, especially because those blades are seriously sharp. An onion stands no chance against those blades. All of the different tools/slicers are really awesome and work really well for the most part.It isn't quite as big as what I thought it would be when I purchased it, and to give you an idea, most of the time I need to quarter an onion in order for it to be diced correctly and not smush out of the sides. If it's a small onion, you can fit half of it in the dicing area and get it done that way. I am extremely happy with the purchase overall, especially at that price, and it has taken away a lot of frustration and time when I cook. Next time, I will probably get one that's a little bigger, but this is most definitely a game changer by itself. Highly recommend this dicer. Just be careful with those blades! They are super sharp and got two of us bleeding within the first three or four days. Lol",

    "reviewText": "This is the lamest product design ever. It does not store easily as advertised because all the stuff that comes with it doesn't fit in it. Not even the manual! I couldn't even figure out how to get it back in the box it came in. So now I have to buy a box to put it all in, so I don't lose pieces and parts. Very, very, very disappointed. This problem could have been easily avoided with a better design for the product, or if they included a plastic box just big enough to store everything in.The cutting area is pretty small, so you have to cut your produce or whatever in half or so, so that it will fit on the cutting area and you can close the unit to do the cutting. Again, lame!!! Again, the problem could be easily avoided by making the product larger in general. That said, it does cut as advertised, at least with the \"garnish blade\".I bought this specifically for making Pico. That means using the small and maybe the large dicing blades. The goal was to have a quicker and easier way to do it, rather than using my big kitchenaid mixer with the food processing attachment. That device does a wonderful job by the way, but our kitchen is very small so my wife makes me store it in the basement. My goal with THIS product was to have something I could keep in the kitchen cabinet.I didn't have everything I needed to make pico tonight, so I used it to make fajitas. I cut onions and three different kinds of peppers with it. For the onion, I had to cut that in half to make it fit in the cutting area so it would cut. For the big bell peppers, I had to cut them in half, and then in half then other way. I really expected better.Overall, the plastic is decent quality for the purpose, as far as I can tell. It also cleaned up fairly easily.I can't comment on its various other functions yet, as I just got the thing yesterday! But that didn't stop Amazon from asking for a review, so here it is.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Stylish and Space-Saving: Why the CAROTE Non-Stick Cookware Set is My New Kitchen Essential",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently upgraded my kitchen with the CAROTE 11-piece Non-Stick Pots and Pans Set, and it's been a game-changer for my cooking routine. The cream white color gives my kitchen a clean, modern look, and the non-stick surface truly lives up to its claims. Food slides right off, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love that I can use less oil, and even delicate foods like eggs don’t stick, which makes every meal feel healthier and fresher.One of my favorite features is the removable handle, which is incredibly practical. It snaps on and off easily, so I can transfer pots from stovetop to oven or fridge without taking up extra space or needing separate storage for bulky handles. This space-saving design has been perfect for my small kitchen and would be amazing for anyone with limited storage or even an RV setup. Plus, the set is induction-compatible, which opens up a lot of versatility, especially if you have mixed appliances.Overall, this CAROTE cookware set has been an ideal addition to my kitchen. It's lightweight but durable, easy to clean, and does everything I need it to do, from stovetop to oven to fridge. It’s been a worthwhile investment, and I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. If you’re looking for a practical, stylish, and space-efficient cookware set, I highly recommend giving CAROTE a try!",

The removable handles are great and easy to apply and remove. The color is lovely, the little dots give it a little extra something that looks very nice. The fact that you can take them from stove to oven to the table and they still look cute it’s definitely a great extra. Heat distribution is amazing! Everything cooks very evenly! The stacking makes is easier to store and they are also super easy to clean.",

    "reviewText": "I love the nesting feature, but I am constantly worried about using a very high temperature while cooking. According to the instructions it strongly suggests to use a medium flame. Also, there is a weird grayish residue between washes on the bottom exterior of the pans. I think other than scratching each other that’s the reason for the felt dividers that came with the set. I feel like it should have one more large pot lid added so you can use multiple pots simultaneously. The cold storage lids don’t snap on, so they don’t feel secure when storing food in the fridge. Easy to clean both by hand and in a dishwasher.",

So far they seem to cook through very evenly they're heavy weight and easy to clean. They're very pretty looking and it's super convenient to have the handle store next to it. Also the lids are nice that they function is a cover and the whole pan and lid can be put into your refrigerator together or take into another person's house. It eliminates the need for Tupperware. For the price I have found these in extremely good buy and would recommend them to other people",

The nonstick coating is impressive – even with minimal oil, food slides right off without sticking. This makes cooking so much easier and clean-up even faster, as I can simply wipe the pans with a sponge and they’re good as new. Another thing I love is how evenly these pans heat up; whether I’m cooking vegetables or frying eggs, there are no hot spots, so everything cooks perfectly. The set feels durable and well-made, with comfortable handles that stay cool while cooking. Overall, this set is an excellent value for anyone looking for quality, user-friendly frying pans.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Initial Impression",
    "reviewText": "I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so \"skating\" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.",

    "reviewText": "We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next \"adventures in cooking\" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.UPDATE:First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking.- WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting.- NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability.- HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a \"plate\" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils..- STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment.Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both.Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY.",

    "reviewText": "These bowls and lids are great. I love the shredder and slicer and they clean up easily in the dishwasher. I recommend placing the lids on the top dishwasher rack to ensure the lids maintain their shape but even on the bottom they maintain their shape and seal if you place them on the bowls and leave them on for a while. The sizes allow you to measure, mix, and store right in the bowls. The silicone base is the best feature and provides a firm foundation as you mix vigorously. The extra measuring tools and silicone utensils are a nice bonus. Would buy again as a gift!",

    "reviewText": "I have a go-to set of mixing bowls that I love. But sometimes, especially during holidays and large cooking get togethers, I want to use a different set so I am not forced to wash and dry my set of 4 so often. So, in preparation for a large gathering weekend, I bought this set. I used many of the bowls and lids for the mass cooking adventure. I was pleased with the sizes and appearance of the bowls. I was able to use them for serving some dishes too. The lids worked well. I did not use the shredding feature so I cannot comment on that.I will note that the bowls are not thick or very sturdy. I hand washed all pieces so that they would not be warped. I saw in other comments that the kids warped over time. By hand washing, I suspect that won’t happen to mine. They are not thick, I emphasize. I do not plan to use these as my sturdy, everyday pieces but they will serve well as my secondary set. The metal is shiny but I suspect it will dull and scratch over time but that is just aesthetics. I love the bottoms as they do not move when mixing. For the money, this is a great set of bowls. I would not use them daily but I recommend them for back up prep and storing.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars How to Care for a Damascus Knife",
    "reviewText": "I seen a few negative reviews about rust, FYI moisture is the worst enemy to this type of steel.Here is how to care for your Damascus Blade. I collect Katanas, which are all Hand Forged blades.FYI: the picture of knife darkens the blade so you can see the Design.When heat treated and used in a blade this combination holds an excellent edge. The blade will gain an attractive patina with prolonged use as with any Carbon steel based blade. The colour and character of the patina is determined by the type of ingredients and food the blade is used to cut. For example, cooked red meat creates a beautiful blue-grey patina that will be familiar to anyone who has encountered heirloom carving knives.Caring for your blade:Caring for a Damascus steel blade is much the same as for a Carbon steel blade - moisture is the enemy. Once the blade has built up a patina it is much more forgiving, but a fresh Carbon steel based blade will begin to rust in a heartbeat.Never, ever: NEVER!Leave the blade resting in standing waterRest the blade on a damp tea towel, wash cloth, etcStore in direct contact with leatherWash in a dishwasherTo help your Damascus steel knife become a heirloom, there are only a few things you need to do.After use:Rinse clean under running water and wipe dry with a clean clothLightly oil using food safe oilStore in a dry placeWhile your blade is still developing a patina, it is a good idea to quickly wipe the blade down before moving on to a food preparation task not involving the knife.Oiling - (I use Japanese Sword Choji Oil)- https://www.amazon.com/The-Institute-of-Asian-Arts/dp/B0061LS2SY?th=1&psc=1A common mistake when oiling a blade is to use something like olive oil that will go rancid. I recommend Choji oil, as it is food safe, cheap, and readily available.WashingMany people new to Damascus steel knives approach washing their blades with trepidation. Cleaning your knife is straightforward: rinse it under running water, give it a wipe with a lightly soapy dish sponge, rinse it again and wipe dry. If you’re familiar with the term “Bachelor Wash” (or can decipher the connotation), this is all it takes.Refreshing the patternThe Damascus pattern will fade with use - this is normal and easy to rectify. Hot black instant coffee (cheap, nasty, and mixed at a ratio that would kill a large animal) is a mild etchant that is used as the final stage of the Damascus etching process. It is element of process that contributes most to the blackness of the pattern.Here’s how to refresh your own blades:Brew a batch of the cheapest and nastiest black instant coffee you can get your hands on. You’ll need enough to immerse the blade in.Wash the blade, then thoroughly wipe it down with methylated spirits to remove oils and contaminantsImmerse the blade in the instant coffee, heating the coffee back up if it’s gone cold (heat increases the rate of reaction). Take care to avoid getting coffee on the handle.Expect the process to take anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour. Check the blade every 15 minutes by removing it from the coffee and allowing the coffee to drip off. Do not touch or wipe down the blade at any point.When the desired results have been achieved, remove the blade from the coffee then wash as normal before oiling and storing.",

    "reviewTitle": "BEYOND SHARP!",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The best part is the smooth gliding RAZOR edge this knife has out of the box. It's a Chinese made VG-10 steel, damascus style (I can't verify how many layers this really has), but VG-10 steel has a great reputation. The knife shipped OVERNIGHT and by coincidence, I bought fresh Walleye AKA Pickerel today at the grocery store. I've used a survival knife to do this before, but it left way too much meat on the skin. This knife just slid right through. If you're OK buying a knife made in China, I'd pick one of these up. The hype is real.Downsides:1) Nobody can really say if this is damascus or just damascus style, nor have I used it for more than one task, but without seeing the manufacture process, it may or may not be.Fun facts:The VG10 steel is native to Japan. 9CRMOV10 or whatever the top rated Japanese knives are made of is a Chinese steel, copying the VG10. How can a genuine Japanese chef knife (like most of the top rated ones) be made out of a Chinese composition steel, yet still be Japanese? This Japanese STYLE chef knife is made from higher grade steel than any of the Chinese 9CRMOV10ABC steel used in most top rated competitors and it's cheaper.Good stuff gets made in China, and so does junk. For the price point, VG-10 steel and quality so far, I'd have to say this is an excellent knife and not junk.Update Several months later: I can still shave with the blade. To be safe and remove any micro burrs, I dragged it through a ceramic v shaped sharpener for three passes, applying no pressure other than the weight of the knife. The blade is still scalpel sharp and glides through EVERYTHING. USE A WOODEN CUTTING BOARD! ANY blade will eventually suffer damage if it's slammed into a glass cutting board or countertop enough times. I didn't HAVE to use the ceramic either. Removing any micro abrasions from any blade helps them stay sharp, but not essential for this knife. It stayed razor sharp on it's own, so I take good care of it.The hamon line on the edge and damascus pattern in the blade are incredible! From one steel worker to another: great job! Worth EVERY PENNY!",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Accurate and Reliable with Convenient Features: Amazon Basics Digital Kitchen Scale",
    "reviewText": "The Amazon Basics Digital Kitchen Scale is a practical and efficient tool for both everyday cooking and precise food measurement.

The glass platform is not only stylish but also easy to clean, adding to its convenience. The compact size ensures it doesn’t take up too much counter space, and it’s lightweight enough to be easily stored when not in use.Functionality: One of the standout features is the tare function, which allows you to subtract the weight of containers or packaging to measure only the ingredients. This is especially useful for baking or when dealing with multiple ingredients. The scale offers measurements in various units, including ounces, pounds, grams, and kilograms, making it versatile for different recipes and dietary needs.Accuracy and Performance: The accuracy of the scale is commendable, providing precise measurements that are essential for cooking and baking.

The scale also has an auto-off feature to conserve battery life, which kicks in after a period of inactivity.Minor Drawbacks: While the scale generally performs well, there are a few minor considerations. The glass surface, though easy to clean, can be prone to fingerprints and smudges, which may require frequent wiping. Additionally, the scale’s accuracy may slightly vary with very small measurements, though this is common with many digital scales.Overall Impression: The Amazon Basics Digital Kitchen Scale offers excellent value for its price, combining accuracy, functionality, and ease of use. Its sleek design, versatility, and practical features make it a great addition to any kitchen. With just a few minor areas for improvement, it stands out as a reliable and efficient tool for a range of culinary needs.",

    "reviewText": "Scissors are nice quality and do well cutting but have limited use due to difficulty of cleaning. These have limited applications because they don’t come apart for thorough cleaning. Any raw meat packaging or uncooked items that can easily transmit bacteria should be avoided as the bacteria can get trapped where shears are joined. Soaking or dishwasher cleaning ultimately results in rust as water cannot be totally dried. Because of this , they’re not truly all purpose and I will need to invest in another pair that can come apart.",

Good memories!I did have the wattage meter to check the status. On idle it’s 0.2W. On bake it’s ~1,300-1,500W (same as a bedroom space heater). This thing is pretty cool. Toast really well. Got it on sale at $150 during the Amazon Day once a quarter of something. Has been on my wish list for a bit until recently. This thing with right out of the box. Relatively minimal noise level. Can replace the oven, air fryer, and toaster to reduce Valuable countertop real estate. The oven is basically another storage cabinet. Definitely recommend!",

Even though it cooks food quick, I am still able to smell the food around the house. I only wish there was a storage drawer for all the pieces that come with it.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My Instant Vortex died just short of 4 years. I opened it up and reset the thermal \"fuse\". It worked but only for about a minute, giving me the E1 error code. Time for an upgrade. The non-stick trays are also in a sorry state.This upgrade is worth it if only for the exterior stainless steel and the cute French door. Air fryers that open the door down always bugged me. Why can't they have a door like the microwave? Everything drips on the door hinge and the door. I had to get another tray to put on top of the opened door as another drip tray. But when I detached the door of the Instant Vortex, there wasn't much grease dirt accumulated there.The door isn't just cute but fully functional. You can open it with one hand, doesn't matter if you are left or right-handed. You need a little bit of clearance on the sides for it to stay open because it's spring-operated.The interface and buttons are superior. There are only 6 buttons including start and cancel. Others control what the dial is used for, setting time, temperature, cooking mode, etc. The buttons are quality sensor buttons with no moving parts. The rubbery membrane buttons are always the first thing to go in any appliance. The little display manages to tell you if you have a preheat mode and where to put your trays.The basket and rack are quality stainless steel. A short time will tell if they are not. The trays look like aluminum which most baking trays are made of. The grill plate is solid steel with ceramic coating. Many will not buy telfon like non-stick utensils. Many will not buy stainless steel utensils. I'm going for all stainless steel in the kitchen. They are easily cleaned by boiling in water with some washing soda. It's effortless to maintain even a mirror finish.Even the tray handle makes a lot of sense. You don't have one for the Instant Vortex. The rotating mechanism is also all metal.My only hesitation is that it doesn't have a rotating basket. My last use of the Instant Vortes was to roast peanuts, overheating in the process. Since this fryer is much bigger, you can spread the same amount of peanut on the flat basket in one layer. An air fryer is supposed to fry evenly.The Instant Vortex basket can be modified to fit the new host. Unscrew the black supporting blocks for the old rotisserie bars. All you need is a thick drill bit to grind off the rivet holding the old rotisserie bars, take them off, and enlarge the resulting hole a little. Screw the supporting blocks back. The new rotisserie can be put through the holed at the two ends.",

    "reviewText": "This thing can literally do everything... even \"hardboil\" eggs! I purchased specifically for the air frying and because a frozen pizza can be easily cooked in it, but I am amazed by everything that it can do - and how well it does it! The pizzas turn out great and it's easy for even my teenagers to use it when they get hungry. While it can fit a full frozen pizza, I don't feel like it takes as much counter space as some other comparable units (Looking at you, Breville). It's easy to clean. I usually just line the bottom tray of the unit with aluminum foil to make it lickety split. Really glad that I purchased it - it does make dinner a breeze and saves me from having to turn on and heat up a big oven if I'm just feeding myself.",

The air fryer is wonderful for those frozen items and potatoes and the rotisserie works a treat. I’ve used it for baking as well, though I have had adjust cooking times. It will overcook if I follow the instructions on the packet. It is easy to clean and looks aesthetically pleasing in my kitchen. Highly recommend.",

Be careful not to burn yourself. I think it will last longer as a result though. And it works great.My model came with the grilling plate and I love it.The drip tray is removable and catches crumbs well, but to help keep the inside clean for many types of cooking, I also recommend getting third party stainless steel 12.5x9.5 inch baking pans that come with raised baking grills. It will let the air fryer circulate while catching more significant amounts of sauce and greasy drips.",

    "reviewText": "This quilt is not very thick nor is the nap very thick. It definitely has a nap, but it is very low and doesn’t dramatically change color when you smooth it against the grain. The loden color I picked is dark enough to pair with my purple throw pillows as my other comforters are dark purple. Because it is not very thick, it lays flat and offers a clean look on the bed. The shams are simple without frilly edges, but I like the look. The quilt is very thin; it does not really feel as if it is filled with anything, but it has a lot of weight to it so that it is sufficient for winter use. The California King size has plenty of length and width to cover my bed and even the top of my bed skirt - please note this quilt does not come with a matching bed skirt - so it looks smooth and finished when the bed is made. I do wish this set came in a dark purple and not the lavender they offer as I’d get that color in a heartbeat as I prefer this thinner but still heavy style of bed covering. I also like that it is basically the same on both sides so that you can reverse it and it won’t look “wrong”. And the fact that it can be machine washed and dried makes it a good option for someone looking for a flatter, less puffy look for their bed. My only gripe is that it wrinkles a bit.",

The quilt and matching pillow shams are well-made and durable, promising to last through many washes without losing their softness.Overall, this quilt set is a fantastic addition to any bedroom.

The two-wick candle burns evenly across the top. To ensure this, on the first burn, allow the candle wax to liquify across the entire surface. Don’t extinguish it before that, otherwise you’ll never get an even burn.Trim wicks before each new burn & always burn long enough to liquify the entire surface. You’ll never have puddle burns, again.The fragrance of this candle is like a nice forest of fresh fir trees. 🌲 It’s not too strong, but just right.This candle is unbeatable for the Christmas season.",

Overall not a big deal. Very happy with my purchase, I only wish I could buy more!",

Bright enough where I can sit in the office comfortably at night without the need of turning on the room lights. These also help with out with eye strain too that I’ve noticed when using the computer for long periods of time.Getting them up and running was a breeze and it also works just as well with Alexa assistant. Plenty of preset color options to choose from or you can make your own through the Govee App.Only reason I docked a point is because the double sided adhesive strips provided with the panels are abysmal. They lasted for a day before they started falling off the wall one by one. Had to order some 3M mounting tape to get these to stick so fair warning there.Overall I’m pleased with these and many other Govee products. Way more affordable solution compared to the other alternatives. I’d definitely recommend these.",

    "reviewText": "I cannot stress this enough. Please do yourself a favor and watch the instructional video before you attempt to assemble them lol. These lights are better than the nanoleaf lights I bought prior, I can light each panel a separate color and the app made designing a layout a breeze. My only complaint would be the panels are a bit too tight in the wall mount, so it pulled the adhesive right off the wall (along with some paint and a portion of the drywall). This, of course, could have been avoided if I had taken my own advice and watched the instructional video before assembling. The panels are slightly smaller than the nanoleaf brand, so I was able to fit a bigger design on my small space that I wasn't able to do with the nanoleaf panels.",

    "reviewText": "***UPDATE: I was blown away by the Govee customer support after reaching out to them explaining the issue. They were extremely quick to respond (within about an hour) to my inquiry and immediately took steps to rectify my problem. They sent me a replacement that arrived in less than 48 hours, and the adhesive on this batch seems much better after setting them up. I was extremely impressed with the customer service and as I stated in my original review, the actual lights are beautiful. This has made me confident to continue purchasing and recommending Govee's products to friends and family.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I hate to write this review, as I love all of my other Govee products, but this really was a disappointing purchase. I have bought near $1000 of Govee lights over the past couple months and this is the first one that really was a terrible experience.As for the lights themselves, they are absolutely gorgeous. And the actual instructions for setup were fairly easy so no problems there. But oh god, the adhesion I would give a 0/10 if I could. I spent about an hour perfectly planning out my design, measuring for perfect placement, and very meticulously leveling each light panel as I followed the instructions on sticking them to the wall. In the morning I carefully cleaned the wall with isopropyl alcohol just to make sure there was no residue on the walls, then in the evening when it was time to actually install the hexa lights, I followed the instructions and wiped the wall with a dry cloth and then for each light I applied pressure for 60 seconds just to be safe. As I finished getting all the panels up and calibrated, one of the hex lights came unstuck. I wiped the wall again where that specific one fell off, reattached it, and went to sleep. Overnight, 2 of the 10 lights fell off the wall and were disconnected. 3 of the remaining 8 on the wall were not attached, but were just hanging from the support of some of the other lights.This whole installation has been a disaster from the start and has been an horrible user experience, which is a shame because the light quality for these themselves are great. So now I have to make the decision if I need to go and pay out of pocket to buy a bunch of command strips and reinstall all of these completely over again, or I am going to return them. I still haven't decided, but I wanted to provide this as a warning to all others looking to purchase this particular light.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. One of my favorite products, the size and quality is solid. The mounting and serting of your design is much simpler than what I saw through the videos. The configuration is pretty quick. Just have a cleR design on mind or lay them on the carpet and play around until you get the right configuration for you. The colors are super and the panels are Super Super bright. On the pictures and video they were set at less than 5% because otherwize the reflect of the light doesnt allow you to take a clear picture or video.My only call out is that you will have extra \" cable\" between each panel connection as expected so you can have wiggle room, however the panels aren't heavy and the adhesive is pretty averga so depsite that I did spent 30 second pressing each one, as requested in the instructions. However, after a day or two de bending extra cord hidden in the back and the \"average\" adhesive, does not held the hexagons in place. them very well so it end up adding an extra double sided tape so they could stick nicely.Love the quality, size, functionalities,and price its a great product! Go grab yours!",

    "reviewText": "PRO's: Absolutely awesome, so many different configurations and boy do they ever get bright,, so much so that I have to keep them turned down to 20% at the highest, mind you my whole room is full of different Govee lighting on every wall.Super easy to use from the app with so many different colour patterns to choose from who of course you can DIY and works with T1 and T2 display systems, are RGBIC so you can get pure white out of them up to 6500 K or down to around 3000 I believe.Super easy doing install and comes with many suggestions on patterns or of course you can choose your own, so many options with the assignable LEDs inside each hex, let alone the combination of them working in harmony. Great value as they often go on sale for 40% off or so and are much better value than Phillips lighting without trading off any quality, in fact in my opinion it's superior in most cases.CON's: (TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE)",

I placed this on my entryway bench and when you sit to put on shoes or you're getting the dogs collars and leashes ready, it gives off a pleasant smell. But it's not so strong that I smell it all the time or can't burn a candle in the living room without the smells competing. I will likely purchase another one, maybe 2, for other small spaces in the house. Great value, too, since you get the extra fragrance bottle.",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Reed Diffuser Set (Starshine1), and I’m really enjoying the fresh, pleasant scent it adds to my home. The fragrance is light and uplifting, with a nice balance that isn’t overpowering — it creates a calming atmosphere whether in the living room, bedroom, or even the bathroom. It’s the perfect scent for daily use and definitely enhances the ambiance in any room.The design of the diffuser itself is lovely and fits well with my home decor. I also appreciate the rattan reeds, which are stylish and functional. The aromatherapy effect is subtle yet effective, making it perfect for spaces where you want a gentle, consistent fragrance without it being too strong.My only minor critique is that I wish the scent-drawing straws (the reeds) were a bit larger. I’ve noticed that the scent doesn’t seem to diffuse as strongly as I expected, and I think larger reeds would help draw the fragrance out more effectively and fill the room with a more noticeable aroma. That said, it still works well for a more subtle scent and is a great option if you prefer a lighter fragrance.Overall, this is a lovely diffuser set with a great fragrance, and it’s a perfect decorative gift as well. I just wish the reeds were slightly thicker for better scent diffusion. Still, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a nice, relaxing room scent.",

    "reviewText": "This Gonjahon Reed Diffuser Set is a pleasant-smelling reed diffuser with a whole lot of essential oil. There is a main glass bottle which apparently has about 112ml of essential oil and a plastic refill bottle with 200ml more for a total of 10.55 fluid ounces of essential oil. The sales listing mentions the essential oil should last about 120 days or 4 months. And the set comes with 10 black reeds or “rattan diffusion bars.” The smell reminds me of a gentle cologne which apparently is labeled as “early morning.”There is not much for instructions. The box shows removing the reeds and flipping them apparently every 48hours. But beyond that, there is nothing more except for a lot of Chinese Kanji.This is a good essential reed diffuser set. And the glass bottle is elegant enough to place out in the open for guests to admire. As to whether this would turn out to be your favorite fragrance, that is hard to predict since everyone’s taste is different. But it is a gentle, pleasant scent that most people would likely enjoy.",

The concept is smart but they needed to add possibly another bar within the shelf to actually support better. Limited use for shelf because when adding additional items the shelf starts to lower in front part and looks like items will fall off and it’s not flush against the wall. I expected more considering price. Very cute design and great if hanging lighter items then books or albums. Great if for Knick knacks. Would not repurchase for my intended use.",

    "reviewText": "Instructions were clear, and it was nice that it specified the size of drill bits needed. But with the included hardware there is quite a bit of vertical flex to the bracket once mounted as it comes with countersunk screws which the bracket wasn't made for. After finding one of my shelves in particular was too saggy, I bought new screws with wide flat heads (see picture) and they are much more secure.It would also be nice if there was an included way to secure the shelf on the bracket - it just slides on and off. I'm considering whether I want to glue it, or perhaps inset a neodymium magnet on the shelf back so it would hold to the bracket.",

    "reviewText": "We absolutely LOVE this candle warmer that we got for our housewarming present! It's so much safer than burning candles and in my opinion, the scent stays longer and steadier than a live flame. And while it might not be as cozy as a flickering flame, it is so much safer for our home. We have a child who always has friends over, and the candle is always a concern - we don't want kids burning themselves, and now we don't have to worry about it. The candle warmer escapes notice. I did notice this size of candle warmer works best with single wick candles or smaller candles - I think I would need a bigger one for three wick candles, but that's fine. I think this also helps the candle last longer as well!",

I was looking for a way to help reduce some unpleasant scents in my office at work (joys of being located near a loading dock in a large city) and I didn’t feel comfortable with an open flame because I often have to leave my office to address issues in other departments. I love that this gives me a safe way to use my candle stash and that it does so in such a pretty way! People stop in to comment on the great smell from the candles it melts and ask me where I got this great little lamp. I also love the timer feature because if I forget to turn it off before I leave for the night, I know it will shut off on its own!I love that this lamp has an adjustable height to work with any size candle and that it helps my candles last longer than traditional burning! 10/10 on all fronts!",

The clips are mounted to a singular plate that fits behind the baskets and really provides support. Due to the design, the clips all contact the baskets evenly and spread the weight all the way across. It took longer to prep the surface than it did to install the baskets. Start to finish install was under 5 min total and they have held up perfectly.",

    "reviewText": "The only negative I have is, if you've got an apartment sized tub/shower these might be too wide and you'll end up bumping into them with elbows or any body part that's aligned with where you've installed them. However, that's not a design flaw, therefore I didn't take away any stars. They seem to be very sturdy and has great stickiness (I did thoroughly clean the shower walls, rinsed them well, then wiped the areas I was placing the hangers with alcohol. Then I heated the hangers with my blow dryer, used a butter knife to make sure I got around every edge. Then I waited a full 24+ hours to attach the baskets and put items in them. I have huge salon sized shampoo and conditioner bottles with pumps that withhold their weight and me pumping to get the product. I really REALLY want to love these, but having to contort my body every shower is annoying. I will see if they have replacement sticky adhesives and if changing positions would work (shower walls have 2 \"seams\" that stick out, so I don't have unlimited space).",

    "reviewText": "We just renovated our tub/shower surround and it didn't come with shelves, so we needed a solution - hence this purchase. I used a level and frog tape to get these exactly where I wanted them, then lifted the clear panel up and carefully removed the backing, keeping the frog tape on as a guide. Pressed down firmly, then let the adhesive cure overnight before putting the shelves up. It feels like these aren't going anywhere. The install was so easy and perfect. They hold a ton of weight and feel very sturdy. The instructions say warranty is 2 years, so that's encouraging! I will report back if they fail.",

They offer the ambiance of real candles without the worry of an open flame, making them perfect for households with children or pets, or for anyone who wants to enjoy candlelight without the fire hazard. The flickering flame effect is incredibly convincing, mimicking the gentle dance of a real candle flame. This creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. They are made of real wax which enhances the realistic look and feel. The timer function adds convenience, allowing you to set the candles to turn on and off automatically at your preferred times. The remote control makes it easy to operate them from a distance, even across the room. No more worries about accidentally knocking over a candle or leaving it unattended. These flameless candles offer the perfect blend of beauty, functionality, and peace of mind. Highly reccomended!",

    "reviewText": "***There Was No Compensation For This Review******EDITED REVIEW**I've officially owned this machine for over 2 months now. All I can say is WOW. The negativity following this machine makes me wonder if these are other issues that could be causing problems versus the machine.. I read a review *Top Critic* and it sounds more of an internet connection issue versus the machine. The capability of this machine has been amazing. I use this machine now mainly for gaming/fun. I have 3 monitors with peripherals setup (mouse, keyboard, microphone, headset), and have no issues with connectivity or software issues. The machine can handle me streaming on two different platforms and in the same action playing a high demanding game on ULTRA settings and a recording software going at the same time. My GPU is still only around 70-80% and the CPU is running amazing. The cooling of this machine is great and have not had 1 issue since purchase. I would take the critic/negativity reviews carefully.. Don't let those scare you away.. You COULD end up with possibly something wrong but that could've also been from shipping or anything.. If you're looking for a budget PC that can perform very well, than I HIGHLY recommend this PC. Hope this helps!----------------------------------------------------------------Original review belowTo start off, this is a review on the item:Manufacturer Part#: ST-NEBULA-0819-B-AMProcessor: INTEL Core i5 13400F 2.5 GHz (4.6GHz Max Boost) CPUMemory: 16GB DDR4 RAM 3200 Gaming Memory with Heat SpreaderVideo Card: NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6X Graphics Card (Brand may vary)SSD: 1TB NVME SSDOperating System: Microsoft windows 11 Home 64-bitCase: Skytech Nebula Gaming Case, BlackWiFi: 802.11ACFans: 4 RGB Fans for Maximum Air FlowThis PC so far has been great for gaming as well as working from home. The functionality right out of the box has been great and it has been a breeze to get setup. The PC has a folder that comes with it and it shows the step by step guide on how to setup your machine as well as how to troubleshoot if need be. There are many Pro's and few Con's so far since I have owned the Machine.Pros:Packaging for shipping was over the top on making sure it was coming to me securely,Comes as described with little setup needed,Performance has been stellar,Quiet Machine and fans,Case has great airflow,Quality of the product is over the top for the price of this machine.Operates many games on ULTRA settings with 0 issues.Cons:The machine comes with 16gb of DDR4 ram installed and this is a great starter amount but for full potential I would recommend upgrading to the minimum of 32gb of DDR4 or higher.(I upgraded to 32gb DDR4 3200mhz with the 4 available slots)One of the Ram sticks seemed to be not fully clipped into position but took minor adjustment to get setup.The rear fan was loose and rubbing against the case which had a small clicking noise but was an easy fix.Trouble connecting the DisplayPort to a Monitor after trying multiple cords, but HDMI does work well.Cord management inside could be much better, the cables seem to block some of the ports for the RAM and would recommend using some zip-ties to hold them out of the way.Games:GTA-V - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSFortnite - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSBattlefield 2042 - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSWar Thunder - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSMinecraft - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSCan handle many applications open on multiple monitors when working from home such as, Tableau, Excel, Zoom, Teams, Talend, PowerPoint, Multiple query applications (Coding with no issues), Video editing, Streaming.The PC at the price point is worth the purchase, after doing many researches without wanting to build my own PC this was the best Pre-Built machine money can find. Many have i5-13400F processors with 3060's or lower processors with similar 4060/3060's for more cost. At $850 USD this machine will tackle most of what you will need to do unless you're into heavy editing or a big streamer or using extreme applications. This PC is great for overall use.",

    "reviewText": "Ordered this PC from a store called MXC tech because it was on sale it turned out that place was a scam (MAKE SURE TO ORDER IF IT IS SHIPPED AND SOLD BY AMAZON.COM)Been using a decently old laptop GTX 1650 and I5 12450H reason I bought this was because someone broke my main. The jump from those computers to this is actually incredible I’ve never had a computer with an RTX Series card.To the main lighting, when pressing the RGB button it will download the program all RGB in the case is customizable and bright. The size is pretty small the width is a little chunky not going to like but overall smallish pc. Do not let the size fool you it’s powerful I’ve played 3 games on it so far I will give my FPS and stats during using itFortnite - epic settings direct x12 I was running about 60-70 FPS it had a few stutters but that is normal I would say.Went to performance mode on all medium settings ran a constant 238-240 FPS kn the ground while deploying from the battle bus it stuttered a little at the start then eased on, temps never went over 60°C on the GPU. I do keep my room quite cold so that can maybe affect it a little bit.Rainbow six siege - ran around 300 fps I capped it to 240 as it wasnt the most consistent when it was unlimited frames. Constant 999 FPS while in the menu lol.Roblox - anywhere from 140+ depending on the game using max graphics.The keyboard that came with it I didn’t use but it looked like some good build quality.Mouse that came with I didn’t try either.I had 0 issues so far with the computer booted right up I was worried but to my shock nothing went wrong this is my first day using it and it works super good.The value for this computer is really good the parts all together is around $850-$900 so it’s a steal.**Again I rebought this computer from shipped and sold by Amazon.com even if it looks like a good deal do not buy it.**Came with 3 display ports and 1 HDMI on the graphics card.No issue with startup it was simple and easy pressed a few buttons logged in and that was it.Overall this pc is a pretty good computer especially for its price I recommend buying it if you don’t want to break your wallet with prices of computers these days.",

    "reviewText": "My gaming computer celebrated its 12th birthday recently and informed me that it was ready to retire. I have had a Nitro 5 laptop for a couple of years and have been impressed with it, so when a decent deal showed up on Prime day I bought the Nitro 50. It runs MSFS20, TSW5 and most of my older games. And runs them well, I loaded one of the original Railworks routes in Train Simulator Classic and had frame rates in triple digits. Newer, denser routes still had decent frame rates, but everything ran smoothly without any lagging. Other than the differences between Win10 and Win11, the changeover has been smooth and setup was easy. So far I like it.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars High End Power in a Convenient Package",
    "reviewText": "Packaging was excellent, double layers of boxes and foam, and included several custom foam inserts both around and within the case itself to hold all the parts and GPU securely during transit. No wires arrived loose, no ports were bent or damaged, everything was very plug-and-play. While I have my own peripherals already, the included keyboard/mouse performed well when tested and were comfortable to use, and could easily serve as primary peripherals for anyone not looking to spend extra coin on more hardware.Device performs as expected per its specifications - crushing any modern video game title (from Cyberpunk to Helldivers and beyond) with high FPS on maxed out settings, and handles taxing digital workspace functions very well (complex Blender renders, very large Photoshop files, etc). It leaves almost nothing to be desired - anything you might want to play or build, the machine can handle excellently. While not the absolute bleeding edge of current market hardware, this is still clearly a very powerful machine which delivers top-end performance without demanding top-end budgeting.This is my first serious step up from a long line of \"gaming laptops,\" which generally performed adequately but would often show their limitations (especially heat tolerance) under high load. With a large, open, very ventilated case, an impressive suite of fans servicing the GPU and parts from almost every angle, and a direct cooling mount for the CPU, this model has thus far showed no such limitations, and has handled extended play or work sessions in settings like Blender and VRchat without throttling.The case design is fantastic and will make any future cleaning and servicing incredibly easy and convenient - with but a push of a button, both glass panels release and can be opened out like a cabinet, providing immediate access for air dusting or any future part installation. No screws, no snaps, no wrestling with metal plates - just push a single button and you're in. RBG is pretty - I bought this machine for work, not aesthetics, but it does look nice, all the fans and the RAM light up and you can customize it pretty thoroughly. Adds flair without being overbearing.While many PC junkies will sing endless praises of \"building your own\" frankenmachine, I frankly didn't want to waste countless hours researching parts and then stumbling through the nightmare of wiring and assembling everything myself (and facing god knows how many unforeseen troubleshooting obstacles along the way). This machine gave me all the performance I needed in one concise, easy to setup package, and based on its specifications, should hopefully serve me well for years to come.One extra note, though - the Amazon delivery process for this product was not professional and could have very easily resulted in high cost theft. The requested discrete packaging was not used at all (maybe Amazon just didn't have the necessary combination of large box + packaging foam...?), and the driver ditched the package (which very visibly advertises its contents) in front of my apartment and then signed for me himself without even bothering to knock. Thankfully I was watching my door like a hawk that day, and got the package inside immediately - but had I been away at work or errands or some such, this might have been a much sorrier tale. If you spring for this item, make sure to request its delivery on a day when you're free and can immediately receive it. Amazon staff cannot be trusted to respect the packaging and signature process.",

I play Star Citizen religiously and I'm getting between 70 and 155 FPS on a game that has 0% optimization like a champ. Highly recommend this product. On bad thing to say is the box was damaged upon arrival with only damage to the included keyboard which so works but it is bent like an arch which is surprising since the packaging was insane. Also having some trouble with the top and rear case fans rgb. This is minor, and can be addressed with customer support and does not hinder any operations in any way. Skytech knocked it out of the park. Only thing I will be doing is upgrading the basic case fans.",

I really wished i refunded when i had the chance but i was to ignorant, after these 3 years ive seen plenty of videos on these pc scams and ext and you can get this exact same computer for a quarter of its price. dont get scammed just because it looks good and has LED lights this computer is literally useless.

Looking forward to him getting into more robust games in the future so I can teach him how to upgrade his computer. This gives us a solid base that fits all his current needs and also allows us to build as we go. Big bonus is the looks. He absolutely loves the looks of this machine (little too flashy for my taste).",

And I constantly have to unplug the keyboard and the mouse and plug them back in to get them to work. I have to do the same with my camera. The box looks great but what a crappy computer it is slower than DialUp they give you a little USB to plug into the computer to have Wi-Fi. It’s the same size as the USB square that comes out of your wireless mouse. What an awful experience from the very first week I bought this computer to the last right now. It is completely shut down I’m in the middle of a business everything I have is on this computer on the cloud to return which I don’t have access now , it’s just horrible . Look at the second picture behind my computer, you’ll notice that the only things that are plugged in are the monitors, keyboard and mouse. And if you look at the first picture, you’ll notice the errors card via storage device, such as an external USB drive, which we don’t have faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD ROM, which apparently we do now just awful.",

DVD player they should put that in the description saying it doesn’t have one but it’s not there it doesn’t say it does or doesn’t either way I want to use it for other things other than gaming the loads really fast in the Internet is really fast when it’s loaded the games take less time to download to my previous computer I played breath edge and it works fine just got hiccups here and there but you can upgrade.this the other problem is there’s no option or any way to put a optical drive in not a single port and that really ticks me off if you didn’t have one it should be advertise not having one and I would’ve went with the $600 one with the warranty about 700 which only had three fans and 250 Megabytes. The only other option is to go in a sternal optical drive a.k.a. DVD player CD player that’s also a pain in the ass you have to make sure that it’s able to read not just burn learned that the hard way make sure you read the descriptions and look for what is and what isn’t mentioned.To the manufacturer: this is borderline false advertisement you should really mention that it doesn’t have one if you’re not going to install it or even an option for someone who buys it to put one in themselves not everyone streams games online some people still get hardcopies that’s something to take in mine I don’t have a problem with the look I do have a problem with not seeing or mentioning certain things in your description for future references this would be best if an external hard drive doesn’t work I will be getting a full refund and I’m going with a different company very disappointed.",

It sounds like a jet engine while it's running as well. Over all, this PC is not worth the headache I went through. Save your money and look for another option.",

    "reviewText": "I didn't know what to expect for buying a new desktop after 20 years. Everything works great so far and should be good for a long, long time. Its a decent price and good for people who want to do business or make gaming content, i have yet to try out gaming with this desktop but it sounds REAL promising. I like the LEDs and having a set of headphones with mic, bonus. My only problem is that when opened the package, I didn't see any kind of manual, nor link, to assemble my set. Some people can do without it, but newbies like me would have trouble if they're not careful. For example: how to put my monitor together, I managed to put it together luckily, but can't tell if its supposed to be loose with this type of monitor. And another example is the HD port from the monitor: I thought I plug it on my tower but I cant do that lol, its the little things like that.But despite those minor issue, I still recommend buying this set if want for novices. Hope this helps.",

It can run GTA Online between 50 to 75 fps (I cant see more beacause of the 75hz monitor), Fortnite runs perfectly on Performance mode, high settings, expect a few stutters for the few first games. For the E-sports titles such as Valorant and CSGO you'll have no problem running them. Its a pretty good computer for the price to performance ratio. I bought my gtx1050ti from Facebook Marketplace for 65 CAD$. BTW, I bought a different mouse with side buttons from Walmart for $6",

Directions were clear and all tools were included plus extra tools just in case. Great size for my set up space. I originally had a 40 inch desk and it was so small for all that I had on my desk. This 55 inch has so much room for all of my gaming/work needs and it's so sturdy!!! I just love it and I am happy that I got it!

The desk itself is pretty sturdy, and holds all of my gaming setup no problem, with a good amount of arm room.I would’ve liked the desk to to be one single board instead of 3 smaller ones you combine to make the desk. Also the shelf to hold my computer is a tad bit small, with about an inch of my computer not being supported by the shelf it’s supposed to sit on, but I don’t think it will fall off unless it is kicked or bumped hard.The LED lights do not come with a sticky back, and the ones provided aren’t very good. So I’d recommend going and buying some double sided tape beforehand!Otherwise I am very happy with the product and the outcome! Great value for its price point.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Rich, full sound. Easy, plug and play set up.",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I’ve always used the microphone from my computer or Bluetooth headset. With all the ZOOM meetings and working from home these days, I thought it be an opportunity to check out a higher quality mic. I saw these on Amazon and figured it was worth a try as it came with everything – stand, microphone, filters.Straight out of the box with a quick install, the mic worked just as advertised – 100% plug and play into my laptop. To check out the difference in audio quality, I opened up ZOOM and tested the mic. I tested the built-in laptop mic first and head it play back, then selected the new mic and listened to the play back. I was amazed at the difference!The computer mic sounds like you’re taking in an aluminum can. This USB condensing mic produces a full, rich voice recording. I was stunned at the difference. I can’t tell you how different it is from something like the YETI, but it’s worlds different than your computer mic. The set up is also quite convenient as you can push the mic away when not in use and pull it back to your face when you want to use it. Another great feature is that the mic is sensitive enough that it’ll pick up your voice as you look at your monitor and talk – you don’t have be shouting towards the mic.After a week or so of testing the mic, I also learned a few things to be aware of. 1) The mic is sensitive (as with all condensing microphones) so it will catch background noise (like a loud fan). 2) The stand could definitely use an upgrade. It’s great this comes with a stand, but I would say this is probably entry level or slightly better. It works just fine, but I notice that sometimes the mic starts to sag. You’ll have to tighten the finger screws a little once in a while. I did some research for better stands and they cost more than this entire set up alone. 3) You can mute/unmute the mic by holding down on the volume buttons. If you don’t hear anything for your recording, look for the blue light to confirm it’s on and hold down the volume button to unmute.Overall, the mic+stand set is great. The mic produces a rich, full sound and the stand works as intended. It’s 100% plug and play… all you have to do is set up and plug it in.",

    "reviewText": "I’ve never owned a real microphone until now, but boy oh boy I wish I had bought this sooner. Didn’t necessarily *need* one because my headset has a built in one but I have online college classes and didn’t want to wear a full out headset like a nerd. Mic has no feedback, no static, doesn’t cut in and out, and doesn’t require a lot of set up either! Another thing i really like is how clearly you can hear your voice, there is almost no background noise at all and it’s amazing.Be weary and plan ahead where you’re going to put the mic arm because the cable is maybe about 6-8ft long and if your pc is on the floor like mine it might not reach all the way to the side of your desk! (I have an L shaped desk, my PC is on the floor in the corner)",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great mic w/ starter kit!",
    "reviewText": "Bought this mic strictly because I was in need of a mic, mic arm stand etc. But what's even better is that some of my friends have the more expensive microphones like blue yeti and the 100-200 dollar mics for podcasts/recording music etc. and this one is right there with them I feel like. Maybe i'll notice more fractional differences down the road but as a overall mic, its great.The voice quality is very clear, it sounds crisp, no cutting out, no distortion, just a smooth voice with very little background noise. I use it for gaming, talking with friends on discord, even recording some vocals to see what my voice can really do lol. I guess I'm a singer now! It actually sounds better than I thought.It has soft touch buttons to turn volume of the mic up and down, holding it mutes. It just feels like such a satisfying touch.The design is clean, its the same size all around basically, doesn't feel outdated, too big and cheap, it feels like $100+ mic made with good durable parts and nice edges. Love the basically all black design.Overall, like I was saying, now that I have the mic, I would have just paid that much for the mic itself but since I was in need of the mic arm stand mostly, I went with this. Also though, I got a shock mount which actually is nice for not hearing any noise from things touching my desk, etc. I didn't know the value of this until I tried with and without it. The mic arm stand is nice, does exactly what it needs to do, use to have a super cheap 10 dollar one and it just wouldn't move smooth and this one just feels like a crane and its nice.Definitly will buy again, going to pick another one up soon for my girlfriend, built her a computer recently as well and it will be a good combo to have.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this ”refurbished” console in July, and it stopped turning on in November. This was sold as an “Amazon Refurbished” console. The customer support at Amazon told me they wouldn’t replace it, and they wouldn’t take a return on it. The “warranty is for 90 days,” and the console turned into a brick at 120 days, so there’s nothing that Amazon will do to stand behind their product. They told me to contact Microsoft for help. The warranty that Microsoft gives is from the original purchase date of the console. In my case the “Microsoft warranty” ended on Nov. 21st, and the console quit working on Nov. 25th. So lucky me the only thing I can do is pay Microsoft an additional $300 to get this console replaced. So because I’m one month outside of 90 days and 4 days past a warranty that started before I even owned the console I now own a $450 paper weight. And if I want the company to fix or replace it I get to own what will be a $750 console. All because I trusted Amazon to sell a working “refurbished” console.",

    "reviewText": "Shipment was delayed supposed to come in on sunday came on Thursday. Did come in thought UPS not amazon. At first of putting in power cord and HDMI cord ( HDMI cord did work) it would not turn on, but after inserting and plugging the power cord of the xbox off and on several times it did eventually work and then turned on. When it turned on it did restart itself twice but after worked completely normal. After all that no issues came from the xbox. Games like college football and Jedi Survivor has worked smoothly and download speed runs fast. Actually would recommend especially during prime day. A Xbox S 1TB was 350 no shipping while this on prime day in 2024 was 400 with shipping so definitely worth but can be risky with all the other reviews in place. Risk it though because this is way more worth it.",

    "reviewText": "Admittedly, I bought this just for Starfield, but I have been playing Fallout 4 (thanks Oppenheimer!), and I can't stop thinking about it. The Xbox Series S is one of the most underrated consoles because, by a landslide, it has the most bang-for-your-buck. I have been playing my Nintendo Switch for the last 3 years, but once I started using this, I have been obsessed!Although the library is not as impressive as that of the Switch or PS5, it has actually been good for me because I am spending more time actually PLAYING games rather than contemplating which games to play on my backlog.I do understand that this is not for everyone. I suppose that if you have already been \"spoiled\" with top-line graphics, this would feel like a downgrade. However, because I bought this for Bethesda games, I could not be happier.Although it might not have the largest library and only slightly inferior graphics than a PS5 (although I don't notice), this console makes up for those shortcomings with it's lean performance. Although it does \"less,\" everything it does is exceptional and meaningful.The only bad thing is that some games did not run properly when I first booted up the console, but after I power-cycled (turn it off for 10 seconds, unplug for 10 seconds, then start it again), everything runs silky smooth.",

Went to the store to purchase a game of his choice to find out this system is digital meaning you can only purchase games online and not the actual disk. Well after a few days of thinking about it, I thought that was the best thing ever! No more lost or scratched games. So now we just go online and purchase all his games and dont have to worry about anything getting scratched or lost. Also, we have access to the gaming store which allows his access to over 100s of kids games that he really enjoys playing. Win win for this aunt!",

He can charge many things on this device. We love the lights on it. You can keep it one solid color. You can change it to a rotation of the colors too if you like. This has been great for minimizing cords and chargers and cables. Also, it keeps my son from just tossing his headphones down in a chair. This actually helps them last longer.",

I found no trouble matching the red - green - blue colors to both my corsair and razor accessories.the base of the unit has nice flair out with really good non slip rubber bottoms this thing will not move unless u want it to.this is the only bungee i have used, i cannot say its better or worse than any other product, but, it also does exactly what i expect it to do, i set the amount of line i want out and if its not enough or too much, i can make that adjustment and once it is set, unless you physically remove the line from its channel, it also will remain as set.I own several headsets: fits hd600s, dt770, astro a40/50s, hyper cloud headsets....i cant see a headset not fitting on this thing, also, i cant find a single thing i do not like about it.the only negative i could find was price....the usb hub has not failed, not one port, i have owned for 1 year....if someone sells an offbrand that offers the same, the difference could be those port quality and the usb included in the box, to me its worth the price for quality.",

    "reviewText": "The build quality of this stand is excellent and the lights look great, there are just two issues with it. Firstly, this rubber appendage sticking out at me. I have a wireless mouse so have literally no use for this, I'm able to remove it but now have this ugly gaping hole instead. I may be able to ignore it or try and cover it, but for a premium stand this is a bit daft.However the most irritating problem is that the stand doesn't retain the colour I last set it to. I use a docking station and frequently switch between machines, and every time I do I have to keep pressing the button until I get back to my colour.It may sound like a petty complaint but this isn't the cheapest stand on the market and this is a really stupid problem to have. If my cheap and crappy £10 mousepad from China can do it then I don't see why this can't.",

    "reviewText": "Microsoft XBOX ONE is by far my fav system I ever purchased. I have been enjoying console gaming for like decades, since Atari 2600, Intellevision, ColecoVision, all the way through NES, SNES, N64, GameCube, Sony PlayStation, PS2, PS3, ect. There is something about the style and power of XBOX ONE that really stands out. The Series X has faster load times, but I like having the optical disc drive. 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

    "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift and unfortunately was left extremely disappointed. The controller didn’t work, the console freezes during game play with almost every single game we tried and then one week later it will not turn on. Well, it turns on, but nothing will display on the TV other than the Xbox logo. Extremely disappointing and embarrassing given it was a gift. Seems that buying a new one may be worth the money if this is the best alternative. Returning asap and will be using the money toward a new console from a legitimate seller.",

    "reviewText": "I had my 360 S (250 GB) for a few years, it was my media streamer, it was pretty much an integral part of my home theater system. I had just returned the one I purchased at Amazon, pangs of guilt really, there is a GameStop near my house (6 miles, near some great burrito restaurants ). This morning my 360S ate a disk, well, that was it's end. With all the points I had at Gamestop and all the points I would get from the purchase (PS4 or Xbox) new console would make it worth it. Of course there was a great burrito on my mind for the post purchase feast. It never happened, I ran home to set this machine up.The Xbox One set up really quickly, the update which runs at the of the first startup really went fast, I guess there wasn't a lot of internet traffic, it ran in 10 minutes, I signed in with my Xbox Gold ID and lo and behold, everything came back, except of course new games and stuff (music and videos) I stream in from my Mac through NullRiver 360Connect. I noticed my HTR was telling me that I was receiving a DTS encoded signal from my new Xbox One, sweet. I thought the improved spatial sound quality and clarity was in my head, it was, it came through my ears.So now, in spite of a currently limited application base, they have my two favorites, Amazon Instant Video and Netflix. Everything looks and sounds beautiful. I purchased a new copy of \"Watch Dogs\" with some of my bonus points and the game play was really great, I think I'm really loving the Xbox one, as I type this review I'm typing away I'm watching a show done in 1080p with some really nice sound, all in all, this box is totally worth it as a streamer if nothing else. Sure I played Watch Dogs for a few minutes and then went back and listened to some Xbox music, all done in Dolby Digital, which my Mac Mini won't do, but any modern PC will, but that is a subject for another day..What a treat, I got to hear some real sonic imagining and separation, not the usual cacophonous mush that comes out of my Mac Mini. The Xbox one looked around my network and at my history with Xbox music and in a few minutes my entire music library was up and ready to go. Look, I'm like a kid with a new toy, I will probably be up in an all night media fest, if for no other reason than I'm enjoying the sonic imagery and great picture quality.The games will come in time, but right now, an Xbox is once again the primary quality streaming device in my system, now I can have over 100 TB of additional storage and I already have 6TB on the Mac's desktop. All in all with trade in and bonus points the whole thing was a deal. This is one really nice piece of hardware, serving both as a console and multimedia center. It's even pretty and is size wise it's about a 2U rack mount, small and sleek enough to look good in your home theater center. The 360 S had a great sound chip, the One is has an even better sound processor as well as a much better graphics processor.Microsoft was right in some of their ideas about integration into Home Theater, it is a good thing, because so few pay attention to these details, which make the Xbox One a great piece of equipment for any home entertainment system. The Xbox Gold network is about as secure and reliable as networks get. Most server rooms are populated with MS Server Products as I'm sure the Microsoft network is. This is an advantage Microsoft holds quietly over other console vendors.When my Xbox 360 S died this morning all I could think about was the pain of replacing it, once I took it the Xbox One out of the box, the Xbox one took very little time to set up and started producing high quality material with a low signal to noise ratio and great gain to the preamp. My mourning for my old Xbox 360 S was over at that point.It's value as a piece of home entertainment is far greater than it's price.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars It just needed a chance to redeem itself.",
    "reviewText": "Well, I wasn't planning on getting an 8th gen console. I was really in the state of thought, that it wouldn't be much of an upgrade from 7th gen to 8th, like it was jumping from 6th gen to 7th, or 5th gen to 6th. But. I had to reconsider since there where games coming out for the 8th gen consoles I really wanted, so I went on ahead and pulled the trigger. You only live once, amiright? My opinion about the leap from 7th gen to 8th is not that huge, is still the same. It really isn't that much of an upgrade. Just the likes of Xbox One and PS4 has smoother textures and graphics, and can handle more AI and activity than their predecessors. But hey, we're reaching the climax of how much we can do with this technology so it's a given.Now, that I have my views of 8th generation out the way, lemme get to the main course. The Xbox One.I enjoy it. I'm still trying to work around it and get to know it. Know the little new features that is. It's kind of like a 360, but with more. More downloading than the 360 as well. Just to play a DVD, I had to download an app just to make it work. I know. It isn't about watching movies, it's about the gaming. But still. Since previous systems just let you pop in the disk and play your movies, without having to worry installing features is kind of the point. Pop movie in Xbox. Movie plays. Pop movie into 360, movie play. Pop movie into Xbox One. Opps! You've gotta download an app for that! I know it's free. I know it's quick. But it's still stupid. Apps also have a knack for freezing sometimes. Like the youtube app. I'll be in the middle of watching a video, and it freezes. And I can't shut the tab down. The only thing left to do is to shut down the console and turn it back on. Scrolling threw the dashboard has a bit of a lag to it vs the 360. Maybe do to more plastered content? I don't know. I know. Stupid thing to nitpick about. Grain of salt people. But I'm sure these things won't matter with a few more patches and updates.Now that I've got the kinks out the way. Lemme get to the meaty part. The gaming experience. I haven't put too much playtime into it. But so fair, I say it's fun factor is very good. I had a good time playing Forza 6. More games are on the way so I can give this system some more playtime and open it up. This is going to be short since I just the console a few days ago and I need to get more in depth. But so far. No problems with the gaming aspect. Kind of funny thinking back in 2013, people where saying the Xbox One wasn't \"for the gamers\". It most certainly is.physical durability.Unlike last generation, within I year I would start hearing horror stories of reliability issues with the consoles of old. 2 years has already passed since these consoles had been out, I haven't heard any REALLY bad problems with these consoles yet. A few PS4's and Xbox One's bricked at launch, but only a slim few. The rest of time was smooth sailing for these consoles. Sure. The Xbox One isn't the prettiest looking thing in the world, but certainly isn't the ugliest. Like the original Xbox, this thing was built to last. There are huge vents everywhere. From the top to the sides, so no worries about overheating from hours of gameplay. Plus, the thing is really quiet. It doesn't make a peep. Unlike the old Xbox's, the One is so quiet you could hear a fly fart. The 360's fan roars more than Mufasa from The Lion King. I love how I can finally have some peace and quiet, when I have a console on. That's a welcomed change. Controller is not that shabby either. Although the 360 controller will always be my personal favorite. The 360 controller feels better than the One's by leaps and bounds. But when not compared to the 360 controller, the One's controller is really comfy and fitting. No huge complaints there.The verdict.I've only had the Xbox One for a few days, and I'm already loving it. It's not perfect. But it's not horrible like some people want you to believe either. (I'm looking at you PS4 fanboys.) The Xbox One is a fine investment that will give its owner hours of fun playtime for casual and hardcore gamers alike. Don't be expecting huge graphical leaps with these consoles. But don't think it's under powered either. The Xbox One certainly has redeemed itself, after it's horror show of a launch two years ago. So many people expected it to fail, but here we are. People are warming up to it and nodding in respect for Microsoft and the Xbox One turning around for the better.4/5",

    "reviewText": "For the price and renewed original Xbox Console, you might think you'd be getting a good deal. Little did I know that the pop-open tray couldn't slide out on the first day of gaming my favorite game, that being the \"Counter-Strike\" Shooter game for the Original Xbox. So I say to myself: either I leave the Disc inside the Xbox, play CS, and make a promise to myself not to break the disk tray even more. Turns out the console works, but no CD Pop-Out capability. Still works fine. Dare I remove that disc for a different game from the Disk tray, and I would be asking for a no longer working Xbox. however the good news I have to share with you all is that I can still play Counter-Strike on the renewed Xbox I ordered, but I can't play other games because I'm too afraid the tray might get stuck and possibly break. So a word to the wise \"If it's broken, but still works, then don't break it anymore.\" I guess the Xbox has been around for a very long time. Meaning old products come with defects or some kind of technical problem that can't be fixed. But on a good note, Whenever I look at my turned off Xbox, and see the game controller connected to the console, I get the feeling it's telling me to load up Counter-Strike for one more round. Looking at it, makes me want to call this console, the Counter-Strike Xbox!",

Best decision ever. Will update the performance of this phone after a month.Update: For dual sim users, the only minor inconvenience on this phone is there is no preferred sim selection feature on sim settings where i need to switch to my second sim to primary just for the data but overall, the system is not bad at all given that exynos has issue when it comes to temperature and I haven't experienced like a hot uncomfortable feeling (It might differ when you live in a tropical country).",

    "reviewText": "I've been obsessed with it since it arrived. The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.",

I also took off all the game bloatware it came with to free up space. The phone handles all I do very well. I do notice a slight lag between pressing a button and getting a response. I can live with that. For the price, this is an outstanding phone that meets my needs.",

Immediate difference. NIGHT AND DAY. make sure you try this if it's slow out of the box.

    "reviewText": "I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",

    "reviewText": "UPDATE: After having this phone for months I have to say it's the biggest POS that I've ever had!! More glitches than I could list. I took 4 stars away because I'm so angry at all the glitches. Now I'm going to go back to my A10E, at least that was reliable!!I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!",

I Have been to the ATT store to get some help with some settings and they were wonderful, since this phone is no longer directly, available from ATT ,the sales people were really OK with my purchase sold by Amazon. They did tell me that buying the phone from Amazon, was a good thing, rather than buying it from third parties, because of service and warranty issues.",

It's definitely a step up from my previous device, but I honestly expected more from a 5G Galaxy device in 2024.The camera is nice, and the body is solid. The screen is beautiful, visually, but is slow and unresponsive, at times refusing to register taps and swipes.I've owned Galaxy devices before, but the Samsung bloatware on this one takes the cake. Dozens of apps are preloaded that you'll have to either disable or uninstall to get some of the precious memory back, and OneUI is aggressively intrusive, causing compatibility and sign in issues with just about everything you want to use.I suppose this is a case of get-what-you-pay-for, but the user experience seems oddly frustrating, given the promised five years of support.This phone has reaffirmed that the Samsung device environment is not for me.",

    "reviewText": "I received this yesterday and have tried it out for nearly 24 hours now. I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Impressive, Quality Device - Unbearable Bloatware Ruins IT!!",
    "reviewText": "How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are \"system apps\" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, \"just uninstall them and move on!\" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no \"delete\" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like \"com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000\" and \"<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",

    "reviewText": "Honestly I love this phone. I love that the screen isn't glass. It's an amazingly easy setup, unlike Asus or Samsung phones. A large pint of the typical Google Bloatware that you can't uninstall, which is just so dumb. Nobody wants these default Google TV and Google Meet apps. They're garbage and take up battery, memory, and they probably get a ton of your personal data with these things just running in the background. Just terrible. But the phone is amazing. I love that the phone feels way smaller with it folded. It takes up less space on a desk and in your pocket. The front screen is great. Didn't ever care for things like that in the past, but it's awesome having it. The fingerprint sensor is lightning quick, but I'm not a fan of it being on the power button. Better than being on the screen but you have to like do a mental calculation of which finger to press the power button with. But the build quality and construction is top notch. I'm probably going to get another after this one kicks the bucket. The folding gimmick alone is so cool and a nice conversation piece.9.5/10. It would be 10/10 if not for the completely stupid bloatware, that nobody wants or asked for.",

    "reviewText": "I got this to replace an old Nokia phone.I wanted to get something that was small and portable. (Carrying a tablet sized phone is cumbersome.) After doing a little research I found the razr, a phone that folds up and stores easily when not in use.This razr (not the plus version) has a nice, solid feel, has more features than I'll ever need, and is simply a joy to use.I don't use this for games or photos/video... I use it for calls, texts, a few stock apps, and listening to music (it has 128 gigs of internal data, which is fine for me.) I use Ultra mobile, the phone recognized my SIM card without issue.When closed the mini screen has basic functionality, but that's not a con for me, it isn't distracting. The texture of the 'vegan leather' shell gives it a premium feel and look that's appreciated.After tinkering with the UI this would probably make a good minimalist style phone. I like it. 👍",

    "reviewText": "This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as \"In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening\". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as \"Like new\". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One. WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated \"I've never seen this\")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices. Buy with caution!",

It is functional, it is easily connectable, it was unlocked, the screen quality is really good, memory capacity is great, and I was able to finance it with affirm which is $27 a month which is affordable to me and a great value for my wife to have a great phone that she loves and is excited about.
