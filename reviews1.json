    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing, for a refurb of a very old console",
    "reviewText": "I was apprehensive about getting a refurb of such an old console, but I specifically needed nothing more exotic than a 360. The set from Retrorefresh arrived quickly and well-packaged, and was complete. Most of the pieces could have passed for new or almost new. Unfortunately, the console itself had a ding in the corner, probably suffered during packing or shipping. The unit would not boot up. I emailed Dan at Retrorefresh, as instructed on the card that came with the unit. He immediately offered to send me another unit. The new set arrived about four days later, and was just as nice as the first. It booted up easily, and after updating the firmware, I was able to use the unit just fine. I boxed up the defective unit using the original packaging materials and sent it back to them immediately. Two things impressed me about Retrofresh: The components had been well cleaned and packaged (unlike some of the horror stories that one hears about refurb products); and Dan's quick, no-questions-asked response when I reported a problem. I would gladly deal with these guys again.",

Whenever I put a disk in it won’t read it, it’ll say open tray as of there isn’t even a dick inside. I have to open and close the tray 5+ times to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn’t. Some games it won’t play at all. I have a feeling that whoever inspected this thing before resale just looked it over and said “looks fine to me” and pushed it down the line. Piece of junk",

Only way to correct issue was to unplug power.Do yourself a favor and either don’t buy, or make sure you get a warranty. I was able to return mine and the seller was very easy to work with on the refund process.",

Never had any problems before through them. So I figured why not? Well this is the absolute last time I'll be ordering anything that's refurbished or used. This is pure junk Xbox 360. Wasted my money and time. So thank you for that.....I hope this helps the next buyer plz beware of the scams.",

    "reviewText": "After purchasing the \"3 Tube\" lamp; I went on to get the \"Shark\" and the \"Jellyfish\" lamps and neither had the USB or battery power sources. Also they didn't have the touch button to change the colors. Still a cool little light sculptures but I got a definite sense of El Cheapo. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead with the purchase. For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",

He only got to play with it yesterday and part of today, Monday, and we noticed today there is a thinned area/hole under the ear and it is leaking sand. :( this stretchy toy doesn't bounce back to its original shape due to it being filled with sand, so the unique thing about this is that if you drop it for example, it keeps it's flattened shape until you move the sand around and reshape it. Hoping we can exchange it for a new one.Updated from 2 to 5 stars: We returned the first item, got a replacement and haven't had any problems with it, thank you. My son enjoys playing with it. :)",

    "reviewText": "I recently tried Meto Purple Toothpaste for Teeth Whitening, and I couldn't be happier with the results. This toothpaste has truly transformed my smile, and I can't stop showing it off!From the moment I opened the sleek packaging, I was impressed. The tube design is not only eye-catching but also convenient to use. The deep purple color of the toothpaste itself is intriguing and adds a touch of elegance to my daily dental routine.The texture is smooth and gentle on my teeth and gums, making it easy to brush for the recommended two minutes without any discomfort. The minty flavor is refreshing, leaving my mouth feeling clean and my breath smelling great.What sets Meto Purple Toothpaste apart is its whitening power. After just a few weeks of regular use, I noticed a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Coffee and wine stains that had plagued me for years started to fade away. My friends and family even commented on how much brighter my smile looked.What's even better is that this toothpaste doesn't cause any sensitivity, which I've experienced with other whitening products. I can confidently use it daily without worrying about discomfort or enamel damage.Meto Purple Toothpaste is now a staple in my oral care routine, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone looking for an effective and enjoyable teeth-whitening solution. If you want a radiant smile without the hassle and sensitivity, give this toothpaste a try. It's a game-changer!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok, I’m so confused. I didn’t open this for a couple weeks after getting it while I was finishing my last bottle. The seal on the bottle was intact. Unfortunately now I’m outside of my window to return.This was the worst experience ever. At first it was bright purple, for a few days. But even while purple… it felt clumpy and silicone-like. Previous purple toothpastes (including a previous Meto purchase) felt like regular toothpaste that lathered as you brushed… this one doesn’t. It just breaks into smaller chunks and won’t stick to your teeth.I included a video of how it has turned brown and continues to stay that way no matter how much I pump out of it… looks like it’s oxidized? Or just flat out spoiled?! For the record I’ve kept the lid on it 100% of the time that I haven’t used it. Idk but something is WRONG with this one and I will NEVER purchase from this brand again.I’m just praying I don’t get sick from this somehow. Would give negative stars if it were possible- especially since once your window to return the product is over, so is the ability to contact the seller!",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as I had hoped",
    "reviewText": "Was very hopeful that this product would reduce the coffee stains on my teeth. After applying the toothpaste and scrubbing and scrubbing, I couldn't get the purple off that had stained the tartar in between my teeth. It took a couple more intense sessions to fade the purple. There was some fading on the stains on the surface of the teeth but didn't want to look like a Halloween ghoul so did not continue to use.",

    "reviewText": "I normally do not do reviews except for product that really impresses me.I saw this on Instagram and found it intriguing, I have blond highlights and have been using purple shampoo for years. So, I thought lets see if does the same thing.Im here to tell you it DOES- you see results the very first time you use it, it is truly amazing. I bought it for my daughters and my sister.I gave the rating of 4 stars for the flavor- it really doesn't have any taste at all.I use my regular toothpaste first then the purple toothpaste for the clean teeth-fresh breath feelingI highly recommend you give it a try- you wont be sorry.",

    "reviewText": "I was cautious when purchasing this purchasing because my hygienist told me that my natural tooth color is not white like other people and a whitening agent might cause streaking. I chose to give this one a try anyway, and it whitened my teeth to the exact level I was looking for.Not neon white, but not coffee yellow.I have tried bleaching trays w/ blue light, whitening toothpaste couple with whitening mouth wash, and nothing got me to the level of white I was striving for.2 uses if this fabulous product and I am SO HAPPY!Now I just do a maintenance brush once to twice a week to counter act my coffee consumption.",
