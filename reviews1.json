    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing, for a refurb of a very old console",
    "reviewText": "I was apprehensive about getting a refurb of such an old console, but I specifically needed nothing more exotic than a 360. The set from Retrorefresh arrived quickly and well-packaged, and was complete. Most of the pieces could have passed for new or almost new. Unfortunately, the console itself had a ding in the corner, probably suffered during packing or shipping. The unit would not boot up. I emailed Dan at Retrorefresh, as instructed on the card that came with the unit. He immediately offered to send me another unit. The new set arrived about four days later, and was just as nice as the first. It booted up easily, and after updating the firmware, I was able to use the unit just fine. I boxed up the defective unit using the original packaging materials and sent it back to them immediately. Two things impressed me about Retrofresh: The components had been well cleaned and packaged (unlike some of the horror stories that one hears about refurb products); and Dan's quick, no-questions-asked response when I reported a problem. I would gladly deal with these guys again.",

Whenever I put a disk in it won’t read it, it’ll say open tray as of there isn’t even a dick inside. I have to open and close the tray 5+ times to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn’t. Some games it won’t play at all. I have a feeling that whoever inspected this thing before resale just looked it over and said “looks fine to me” and pushed it down the line. Piece of junk",

Only way to correct issue was to unplug power.Do yourself a favor and either don’t buy, or make sure you get a warranty. I was able to return mine and the seller was very easy to work with on the refund process.",

Never had any problems before through them. So I figured why not? Well this is the absolute last time I'll be ordering anything that's refurbished or used. This is pure junk Xbox 360. Wasted my money and time. So thank you for that.....I hope this helps the next buyer plz beware of the scams.",

For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",

He only got to play with it yesterday and part of today, Monday, and we noticed today there is a thinned area/hole under the ear and it is leaking sand. :( this stretchy toy doesn't bounce back to its original shape due to it being filled with sand, so the unique thing about this is that if you drop it for example, it keeps it's flattened shape until you move the sand around and reshape it. Hoping we can exchange it for a new one.Updated from 2 to 5 stars: We returned the first item, got a replacement and haven't had any problems with it, thank you. My son enjoys playing with it. :)",

    "reviewText": "I recently tried Meto Purple Toothpaste for Teeth Whitening, and I couldn't be happier with the results. This toothpaste has truly transformed my smile, and I can't stop showing it off!From the moment I opened the sleek packaging, I was impressed. The tube design is not only eye-catching but also convenient to use. The deep purple color of the toothpaste itself is intriguing and adds a touch of elegance to my daily dental routine.The texture is smooth and gentle on my teeth and gums, making it easy to brush for the recommended two minutes without any discomfort. The minty flavor is refreshing, leaving my mouth feeling clean and my breath smelling great.What sets Meto Purple Toothpaste apart is its whitening power. After just a few weeks of regular use, I noticed a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Coffee and wine stains that had plagued me for years started to fade away. My friends and family even commented on how much brighter my smile looked.What's even better is that this toothpaste doesn't cause any sensitivity, which I've experienced with other whitening products. I can confidently use it daily without worrying about discomfort or enamel damage.Meto Purple Toothpaste is now a staple in my oral care routine, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone looking for an effective and enjoyable teeth-whitening solution. If you want a radiant smile without the hassle and sensitivity, give this toothpaste a try. It's a game-changer!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok, I’m so confused. I didn’t open this for a couple weeks after getting it while I was finishing my last bottle. The seal on the bottle was intact. Unfortunately now I’m outside of my window to return.This was the worst experience ever. At first it was bright purple, for a few days. But even while purple… it felt clumpy and silicone-like. Previous purple toothpastes (including a previous Meto purchase) felt like regular toothpaste that lathered as you brushed… this one doesn’t. It just breaks into smaller chunks and won’t stick to your teeth.I included a video of how it has turned brown and continues to stay that way no matter how much I pump out of it… looks like it’s oxidized? Or just flat out spoiled?! For the record I’ve kept the lid on it 100% of the time that I haven’t used it. Idk but something is WRONG with this one and I will NEVER purchase from this brand again.I’m just praying I don’t get sick from this somehow. Would give negative stars if it were possible- especially since once your window to return the product is over, so is the ability to contact the seller!",

    "reviewText": "I recently tried Meto Purple Toothpaste for Teeth Whitening, and I couldn't be happier with the results. This toothpaste has truly transformed my smile, and I can't stop showing it off!From the moment I opened the sleek packaging, I was impressed. The tube design is not only eye-catching but also convenient to use. The deep purple color of the toothpaste itself is intriguing and adds a touch of elegance to my daily dental routine.The texture is smooth and gentle on my teeth and gums, making it easy to brush for the recommended two minutes without any discomfort. The minty flavor is refreshing, leaving my mouth feeling clean and my breath smelling great.What sets Meto Purple Toothpaste apart is its whitening power. After just a few weeks of regular use, I noticed a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Coffee and wine stains that had plagued me for years started to fade away. My friends and family even commented on how much brighter my smile looked.What's even better is that this toothpaste doesn't cause any sensitivity, which I've experienced with other whitening products. I can confidently use it daily without worrying about discomfort or enamel damage.Meto Purple Toothpaste is now a staple in my oral care routine, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone looking for an effective and enjoyable teeth-whitening solution. If you want a radiant smile without the hassle and sensitivity, give this toothpaste a try. It's a game-changer!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok, I’m so confused. I didn’t open this for a couple weeks after getting it while I was finishing my last bottle. The seal on the bottle was intact. Unfortunately now I’m outside of my window to return.This was the worst experience ever. At first it was bright purple, for a few days. But even while purple… it felt clumpy and silicone-like. Previous purple toothpastes (including a previous Meto purchase) felt like regular toothpaste that lathered as you brushed… this one doesn’t. It just breaks into smaller chunks and won’t stick to your teeth.I included a video of how it has turned brown and continues to stay that way no matter how much I pump out of it… looks like it’s oxidized? Or just flat out spoiled?! For the record I’ve kept the lid on it 100% of the time that I haven’t used it. Idk but something is WRONG with this one and I will NEVER purchase from this brand again.I’m just praying I don’t get sick from this somehow. Would give negative stars if it were possible- especially since once your window to return the product is over, so is the ability to contact the seller!",

They looked noticeably whiter and brighter. What I appreciated most was that there was no sensitivity or discomfort, which I've experienced with other teeth whitening products. The foam has a pleasant taste, making it a breeze to incorporate into my daily oral care routine. Overall, I highly recommend this teeth whitening foam for its effectiveness, ease of use, and gentle formula. It's a game-changer for anyone looking to achieve a brighter smile!",

I also didn't realize until I READ on the product info itself that the effects you might get if you're lucky will be for \"that day only\"... purple cancels out yellow or something like that. This is a gimmick and was a complete and total waste of my good money. Can I get my money back? Please, I bought 2 bottles. I can send them both back one unopened.",

It is easy to use and has excellent whitening power. The smile really stood out and I got more compliments. The purple colorant in the foam offsets the yellowing of teeth caused by coffee consumption. I have tried several to help whiten my teeth and I have had the best results using this product.

I find that other natural toothpastes don’t get your teeth as scrubbed clean like the usual Colgates, Crest, etc. toothpastes, however, this one did. The purple color was did not stain your teeth and it actually lathers up well and turns white. The taste wasn’t off-putting and wasn’t too mild nor too overwhelming. I don’t know if it whitened my teeth much, but one of my friends told me that for teeth whitening toothpastes to work you actually have to let them sit on your teeth for at least 15 minutes each time you brush. I am trying to implement that into my daily routine. For the price, and compared to other whitening toothpastes, I don’t think the price is worth it.",

    "reviewText": "I was super excited to try this carbon toothpaste that also whitens! The packaging is great and the color of the paste is pleasing to the eye. Here's the thing though, I don't think I'm the target demographic because it did nothing for my teeth. I'm trying not to blame the product because my teeth are pretty stained from when I smoked for years and also coffee. So I didn't notice any significant or even insignificant change to the color of my teeth when I used this but when I switched back to my usual whitening toothpaste, I of course noticed it immediately. Perhaps someone without the wear and tear of my dental history will have better luck. This could work on someone with only light staining on their teeth but unfortunately not for me.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted to try this toothpaste as I do not want to spend a fortune on tooth whitening, and because I wanted to try a milder version of the dark charcoal toothpastes that have been around for a bit of time now but shouldn’t be used everyday because they have the potential to damage the enamel.The toothpaste comes in a simple tube with a screw cap and an initially sealed opening. The expiration date is on the box it comes in and is well into 2026, so no worries about taking a bit of time to use this paste.Expressing the toothpaste is almost too easy as the toothpaste seems thinner consistency-wise than other toothpastes. It seems to do a good job cleaning teeth, and although I wouldn’t say it has a pleasant taste, it is also not a bad taste.Rinsing it with just a bit of water by swishing it around gets rid of the paste quickly and I must say I am surprised that all the grittiness from the paste washes out just like that. I am not sure about the whitening effect yet, but my teeth feel clean and my mouth refreshed after each use.",

But... they only contain fluoride and I really wanted something with Hydroxyapatite. I looked around the internet and this was the best option I could find in flavorless. I use a pump of the Hi Smile in any flavor, and a small dollop of this toothpaste. I can't tell any difference in the flavor, or texture. I really like it.",

    "reviewText": "Evexia Science Tooth Powder left my mouth feeling incredibly clean, like that \"just left the dentist\" sensation. It did a fantastic job removing plaque, which is exactly what I was looking for in a toothpaste alternative.However, there are a few things to consider. The flavor is quite strong, and it definitely takes some getting used to using a powder compared to traditional toothpaste or gel. The switch in texture might surprise some people at first.Despite these initial adjustments, I've been very impressed with Evexia Science Tooth Powder's effectiveness. If you're looking for a powerful plaque remover and don't mind a strong flavor or using a powder, then this product is definitely worth a try!",

    "reviewText": "A family member recommended I try the Honest Tooth Cleaning Powder. I've used it for a while now and am glad to see it's offered through Amazon. I love the mild flavor -- not overpowering with mint. Most toothpastes I've tried leave a film on my teeth, but this tooth powder leaves my teeth clean. I like that the pH balance neutralizes to reduce bacteria in the mouth. That has to be a good thing. Best of all, it reduced the plaque on my teeth sufficiently for my dental hygienist to mention it at my last two appointments. One thing I do when using this product, is to scoop out a small amount of the dry powder into a small bowl. I then dip my wet brush into that, instead of risking getting my main supply wet and clumpy from a wet toothbrush. It seems to work better for me that way.",

    "reviewText": "The 2 speed TORNADO ELECTRIC SPIN SCRUBBER is a lifesaving tool to help ease the workload of the average homeowner. If you are like me, the cleaning of the tub and shower seems to be the hardest chore in the house. My shower is tile, and it gets dirty fast. but then again so do I. Having to ability to spin scrub the Tile and the Grout saves me so much time I can watch the latest football game on Prime and actually have a decent meal. I can honestly say that using the Tornado scrub cleaner has saved my back and knees, which is so important when it comes to home chores.I give the TORNADO SPIN SCRUBBER a 5 out of 5 rating for saving my back and knees, efficient cleaning and long lasting charge.joe",

    "reviewText": "This product is well-made and has excellent form, but the function was off for me. That being said, the product description is accurate; it's an ear irrigation flushing system, nothing more, nothing less. The tip disperses three streams of water that quickly empty the water cup into your ear canal. For me, at least, the process was not messy as the exiting water fell into the sink and not on my clothing. There are two buttons on the machine; get familiar with their function and positions if you're operating the machine by yourself. Otherwise, you might accidentally increase the pressure or prematurely start the machine, spraying water all over your bathroom.Now, back to the function: I was expecting something more, like pulsating or spiral streams of water. I believe I have clean ears, and I did not see any earwax removed after using the machine. After using the machine, I was able to extract earwax manually with an ear canal scraping wand. I don't think water alone would remove this ordinary earwax unless it came into direct contact with a pressurized water stream. Since there are only three fixed streams, only three spots on the outer ear canal are directly exposed to the full stream cleaning effect; the rest of the ear is exposed only to a water flush. If you are the in the market for ear flush irrigation machine this is the product for you.",

    "reviewText": "I have a confession, and that confession is I've become helplessly in love with ear irrigation. I know it's not the healthiest thing, but I WAS told it's better than all other versions of ear cleaning and so I'm sticking with it. I am not a doctor.That said, I CAN tell you my ears are disgusting. When I was a kid they were constantly compacted, and now they are just constantly itchy, and regularly mild scratching around the edges of the hole causes clumps to fall out, and they STILL get compacted. I have so much ear wax being produced at all times.And again, let me reiterate: ITCHY. SO. FLIPPIN'. ITCHY. And there was for the longest time nothing I could do about it! I did hydrogen peroxide cleans and ...that doesn't really help the itching, it more just...makes me dizzy and sort of cleans my ears. Various mineral oils didn't help the itchiness either. Nothing did.Until...this. I got this. I used it. First, just SO MUCH NONSENSE came out. Gross stuff ahead but ten massive clods came out, and afterward, my hearing was much better - I cranked down all my volumes a good 10 levels because suddenly I could hear again. But the FEELING. THE FEELING OF HAVING SOMETHING SCRATCH ITCHES I'D LONG SUFFERED...it was true euphoria. It was heavenly. I transcended to another plane. I needed a cigarette once I was done.And now, a few days later, my ears still don't itch again. They just feel good. And I can still hear. And already another massive clod HAS fallen out of my ear but -- I am so excited to have this on hand for when things start itching again.More boring level: It's very sturdy and easy to use.",

The pressure was good, but no ear wax came out. I really wanted to like this, but after using it, my ears actually felt plugged. Two hours later and lots of q-tips trying to soak up the moisture, my ears still feel plugged. From now on, I will leave ear irrigation to the professionals.",

    "reviewText": "This ear irrigation system is compact and portable enough to take with you on vacation. The water chamber is emptied out the spout in 3 streams of water that do not rotate, pulse, or in any way agitate the earwax. The water gets warm, but not really hot enough or strong enough to dislodge stubborn wax. But this is probably a good thing because if it was too strong or directed into the ear drum it might cause damage and we wouldn't want that. It is good enough to help warm and loosen the wax so you can get it out with a scraper or to help assist the stubborn wax to come out of your ear when you can't get it with an ear scraper. My son had a heavy wax build up when he was small and the irrigation system the doctor used was huge in comparison to this item. If I would have had this back then the process would have been so much easier. But just remember to take it for what it is, an ear irrigation system. It just heats up and pushes water into your ear. It isn't a jet stream or a power washer.",

    "reviewText": "First, a caution. This is not a toy and while kids no doubt would like to play with the \"fountain\", it should be kept out of reach and never be used without adult supervision and control. For anyone, this could cause severe ear damage if used incorrectly. Also, start on the low setting and do not jam into your ear, just gently insert the tip.Warnings aside, this is a well built device. Some quirks, like the power connector is inside, above the water reservoir. Another is that the water reservoir doesn't screw on, but it looks like it should. It uses a rubber gasket to maintain a seal, but it feels a little loose. The other item of note is that while it uses a USBC charging connection, it only seemed to work with the cable it came with. My other USBC cables did not work.After testing on one ear I used a q-tip to gently go around the outermost area of the ear canal. It came out clean. On the left ear, not so clean, so it worked. I've used other devices and this one is much quieter and made for a better experience.Overall I'd recommend this, just be careful when using it! The medium and high settings make for significant water pressure.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Effective and Easy to Use – High-Quality Ear Cleaner with Camera!",
    "reviewText": "I was a bit skeptical about using an ear wax removal tool with a camera, but this device exceeded my expectations in every way. Here's my experience with the Ear Wax Removal Tool Camera:Clarity & Camera Quality: The 1296P camera quality is excellent! I was able to clearly see inside my ear, which made the whole process much safer and more effective. The 6 LED lights provide great illumination, so I could easily spot and remove any wax. The image was sharp and detailed, much better than I anticipated for such a small device. It’s reassuring to see exactly what I’m doing while cleaning.Ease of Use: The setup was simple, and connecting the otoscope to my iPhone was quick and hassle-free. The app interface is intuitive, and the live feed from the camera was smooth with no lag. The tool itself is well-designed, with a comfortable grip that made it easy to maneuver inside the ear without any discomfort. It comes with different tips to suit your needs, and I found the whole process straightforward, even as a first-time user.Comfort & Safety: I really appreciate the silicone tips that come with the tool, as they are soft and gentle on the ear canal. The camera gave me peace of mind because I could see exactly where I was going, reducing the risk of pushing wax further into my ear or causing irritation. The device also feels sturdy and well-made, which adds to the overall confidence I had while using it.Versatility: The fact that this tool works with both iOS and Android is a big plus. I used it on both my phone and tablet, and the experience was seamless on both platforms. The tool isn't just limited to ear cleaning either—I've used it to inspect other small areas, and it works great.Overall: This ear wax removal tool with a camera is a game-changer! It’s easy to use, the camera quality is superb, and it makes ear cleaning much safer and more effective than traditional methods. I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a reliable and high-tech way to keep your ears clean. Well worth the purchase!",

It's neat to own and, for other purposes, great to have a micro camera.",

    "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings about this ear wax camera. I thought maybe I would be able to see down my ear canal to the eardrum, but that is not possible because the canal curves. Also, the scraper sits in front of the camera and would need to be way down the canal before the camera could see. I don’t feel this is safe to put down the ear canal. The metal scrapers included with the kit are definitely not safe. Don’t put this stuff down your ear canal! Leave that to doctors.Now the mixed feeling part is because the camera is actually pretty cool. You can see things really close up. It functions like a low power microscope displaying on your phone. I ran it across my skin and could see every pore and every hair and every blemish in super close detail. Creepy looking honestly. I was able to see around the sides of my teeth close up. I could see the individual pixels on my TV screen. You get the idea. The app takes pictures and video too.",

    "reviewText": "Where do I begin?? I have always wanted to try one of these ear cleaning tools but have been afraid to. I've seen reviews on similar products about the tips breaking off and people having to go the emergency room to have it dug out. Well, I can tell you that you won't have to worry about that happening with this product! The whole metal tip piece is one solid part, from the pen and camera tip down to the scooper tip, it is all one piece. This product came with a lot of little extras; you get a vial full of extra scooper covers, some are different shapes! You also get a charging cable (type C), and a little pouch of metal tools. There are several scoop tools and a little whisky looking one, but I have no idea what they are for. The instructions that came with this device were clear enough, but there was no instructions given on what the extra metal tools are for or how to use them (see listing picture for the extra metal tools).I expected that this device would plug into my phone to use it, but it actually connects via WiFi (no, not bluetooth either). You hold the button on the device down until the light flashes, and then you open your phone's WiFi settings to connect to the device. Once connected, you press \"Start\" in the app that you have to download to use the pen.From there, it's all fun and games. I was afraid of going too deep into my ear, because the little spoon end sticks out a bit from where the camera is. I was SO surprised by how clean my ears were, but also by how hairy they were. Looking inside your ears is both amazing and horrific. Although I didn't find any golden ear wax treasures inside my ears, I was astounded by the amount of blackheads I had on my outer ear; How embarrassing! I pressed the spoon tip against my ear using the camera to find every little pore, and I was able to eradicate the problem pretty effortlessly and painlessly.If you have ever been on the fence to purchase an ear cleaning camera before, this is your sign to buy this one now!! You will NOT regret it!",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Handheld Pressurized Steam Cleaner",
    "reviewText": "My opinion is that this steam cleaner is perfect for anyone who is looking for a method of cleaning their house that does not involve the use of chemicals, particularly for removing tough filth and grime. The fact that it comes with a variety of attachments is a significant advantage since it enables the cleaner to be adaptable enough to deal with a variety of surfaces and chores. The fact that this steam cleaner is both lightweight and small is one of the things that I particularly like about it. I believe that the mobility of this product is a significant benefit, particularly when it comes to cleaning areas such as restrooms or even the inside of your vehicle. It is simple to transport from one room to another. The deep gray color gives it a sleek appearance, and the ergonomic handle makes it easy to use for extended periods of time, which is ideal for cleaning applications. I am grateful that it warms up in a relatively short amount of time; it requires just a few minutes to get ready for use, and I did not get the impression that I was waiting around to get started. The set consists of twelve components, which include nozzles, a brush, and attachments that are designed for a variety of surfaces. The results of using the little brush to clean the grout in my bathroom were extremely impressive, and I am quite pleased with the outcomes. Because of the pressured steam, I was able to remove the filth that I had previously battled to remove with more conventional ways in a short amount of time. I believe that the steam is strong enough to remove debris that has been adhered to surfaces without the need for an excessive amount of physical effort, and I believe that it makes cleaning more effective in general.",

    "reviewText": "So far I have used this on my windows, baseboards, mirrors, and all in my car. Works absolutely amazing. Easy to use, all you do is put in water and wait then it’s ready to use. It’s really good to get out and stick gunk like drinks spilt and gum that’s very stuck. Also it’s amazing for disinfecting which is why I used it on my entire car. Theirs a lot of different attachments for multiple uses so I think this is an essential for any home/car owner",

I personally really don't like having to stop and wait for the cool down and then the heat up to only get to work for a couple of minutes.That being said, I have never used a steamer before and I was able to quickly understand what to do to get this working. The instructions are pretty well written. Not perfectly clear, but good enough.The included measuring cup is very convenient as it is marked with the maximum amount of water you can put in.I tested mine on buildup in a shower. I tried it out on glass shower doors and on the bottom of the tub and on some grout. I did need to learn to go slower with it and let the steam do its job. I do think I will get better at it over time. If I can be patient enough to wait through the process.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this about a year ago and then stashed it away next to my vacuum cleaner knowing that I would probably use it one day. I've always been able to get the lint out of my filter, but I was getting tired of seeing a little bit of trailing lint down toward the bottom where I couldn't reach. I used to use chopsticks and covered the end of them with duct tape and that would get some of the lint out but it was a real pain in the butt. Anyway, I know this is kind of long, but I also think it's kind of funny and that I thought somebody could use a good laugh. I have a kitty at home who, if I don't put her dry food somewhere out of sight that I haven't put in the Tupperware yet for freshness, she will get into the bag and rip it open. I'm sure some of you have experienced similar situations yourselves with your pets. Anyway, happenstance would have it that I put her dry food bag in my dryer one day just to keep it out of sight. While my daughter was visiting one day she threw all the freshly cleaned clothes into the dryer and started it up without checking the dryer drum. You guessed it! After about 20 minutes we were hearing rattling around like pebbles or something and she went and opened the dryer. And oh my God, what a surprise we had awaiting! There was dry kitty food everywhere and thankfully it wasn't mushy or anything because the heat from the dryer must have unglued the glue on the cat's food bag and just opened the top. And holy cow, those bags are tough because it wasn't ripped anywhere! But then of course I had a horrible mess all over inside my dryer. And yes, it freaked me out. We shook the clothes out one by one and then I was left with the task of getting all the dry kitty food out of the dryer. I was able to salvage just about all of it with some of it of course catching in the dryer filter. I remembered having this vacuum cleaner filter for sucking out dryer lint and dug it out and oh my God! It worked like a charm and got every little bit out of there and I was able to vacuum out all the dustiness and everything from the kitty dry food. And then of course I went all over it again with a damp cloth and I even sprayed it with a little bit of air freshener. Thankfully, I didn't use fabric softener when I washed the clothes or when I dried them, or of course it would have ruined the kitty food. I think it's kind of a funny story and I'm so thankful that my dryer is fine and working great. Thanks for making a wonderful product and I'm so very thankful to have!",

    "reviewText": "I love that this bends at different angles and that you can use it as a short handle or long one. The quality is great and it is very sturdy. It doesn’t bog down at all while you’re using it trying to get grime out of corners but I feel like the bristles could have been better. After one time of use, the bristles were pretty bent up and some were coming out of the brush. It is pretty powerful and lightweight. It’s a great value for what what you pay for it. There are multiple speeds but I feel like the highest speed works the best. It definitely gets grime off of things without having to hand scrub them but if you have a tough job, it won’t work well.",

The Speeds are ok, but the top speed you really have to hold on tight. Also I had to put a lot of pressure to scrub, still it did not clean the build up in my shower. I would like to have at least one cleaning head with harder bristles for the more harder cleaning. After I charged it the first time I've used it 3 times for about 15 mins. and it's still working so I guess the battery is pretty good. I think I'm going to keep it to wash my cars or some mild cleaning.",

The included microfiber pads are highly effective at picking up dust and dirt, and I appreciate that they are washable and reusable, making this tool both eco-friendly and cost-effective.Using the Baseboard Buddy is not only efficient but also time-saving. It significantly reduces the effort and time I used to spend on cleaning baseboards with traditional methods. The tool glides smoothly along the surfaces, leaving them spotless and free from dust buildup. Additionally, the handle extends comfortably, giving me better control and reach. Overall, I highly recommend the Baseboard Buddy for anyone looking to simplify their cleaning routine. It has truly transformed how I approach baseboard maintenance and has become an essential part of my cleaning arsenal!",

Well, someone can remove and clean, not me. The cloth is really stuck on there. The plastic head is very flimsy and unscrews itself from the pole as you use it. I had to stop and screw the head back in three times while cleaning the baseboards.That said, the baseboard cleaner does a great job on a difficult task. The head could be more study and the cleaning cloth easier to remove, but the concept is a winner.",

I love that I don’t have to move heavy furniture to do a whole wall. Its great for going in between the balastrudes on my staircase, fits perfectly between the rails. It’s also great for cleaning the horizontal wooden bars in between chair and barstool legs. No more bending over! I use it to dust the base of my Peloton, treadmill, and lamps as well.Pro tip: I bought the Zep foaming wall spray suggested with it. Worked great for greasy kitchen and sticky bathroom baseboards.",

    "reviewText": "I received my baseboard cleaner last week and have now used it multiple times as I walk around my house with it in hand! It does a great job. I've been cleaning my actually dirty baseboards with a new scrubber, which does a wonderful job. But many are just dusty. I will use this for keeping them all free of dust and debris. After reading all the negative comments about the flimsey handle prior to purchasing, I didn't even put that handle on it. I went straight to my garage and picked out a perfect length paint roller handle, screwed it on perfectly, and went to work. So I would happily recommend this product to all of you who like to have clean baseboards.",

The cleaning pad is really difficult to remove from the unit as the Velcro is incredibly strong which makes it difficult for arthritic hands. Secondly, even though I squeezed the water out of the pad before attaching it to the pole, I found that, when applying pressure to the baseboards to clean them, water dripped out of the pad necessitating having to get down to wipe up the wet. The cleaning pad is made out of some unusual fabric and it does not want to hold the water you put on it.",

But this device is surpassing the results/expectations by a mile already. I’m on treatment 8 or 9 now & barely have any hair growth & I am doing full body pretty much! I am Hispanic & come from a family of very thick, stubborn hair. However, I am pretty pale but still struggle with the dark, thick hair. My skin is so smooth & soft now. The device is lightweight & so easy to use. Pain is minimal, most of the time I don’t even feel anything. It’s quick. It works so well, I bought one for a family member. I did experience a blister on my first use, but haven’t since then & I am using it at the max level. My skin tends to be on the more sensitive side, so I was not worried & it healed just fine. Literally love this thing, it’s the best purchase I’ve ever made & the price is great for what you get in the end! This is a must!",

    "reviewText": "I’m not kidding about this product, this is my genuine and honest review:I’m a Latina, I struggled with dark, thick, wire-like hairs on my face, mostly beard area. I waxed for years and always had ingrown hairs and constantly had to pluck missed hairs that the wax didn’t get. The ingrown hairs were so bad and painful and would often leave scars from when I’d dig out the hairs to pluck. I’d have to wax at least every week because these hairs insisted on growing back quickly. I’d go to work with irritated skin from the wax and it sucked because coworkers would tell me why my skin was red and irritated, I was always embarrassed having to explain it’s from waxing at home. I was super self conscious about the heavy hair growth on my face, sideburns, chin, and mustache area. After 4-5 years, I finally gave up on the wax and looked into laser hair removal. I got some price quotes to get lasered professionally but it was always out of my budget. Then I did some more research on at home laser devices and stumbled on this one. They had a great deal at the time and I got it for 70% off which sold me right away. I read it takes time to actually see some progress so I was patient and used it consistently about once or twice a week followed by putting aloe Vera on my skin after use. I did this for about 3 months and I’m extremely happy to say these hairs hardly grow back!! And when some hairs do grow back, they are thin, almost clear looking hairs that feel like nothing when plucked. I can go months now not even using the laser and the hairs hardly grow back. This product really did make me feel so much better about myself and got rid of my self consciousness of having heavy female facial hair. So if you’re still iffy about purchasing, please just do it already. I swear on anything this product really works. I’m extremely happy I no longer deal with having a beard anymore lol",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Two weeks in and I am VERY happy! Mixed girl approved so far!",
    "reviewText": "I have PCOS and am biracial, which makes for a TERRIBLE combo when it comes to managing facial hair. I have had a hairy chin since I was a teenager that was manageable with tweezing or shaving, but as I got older my hair turned into a big thick, coarse, beard any man could be proud of. Me as a woman? Not so much. Soon, there were too many hairs to tweeze, waxing never got all of the hair, and it was impossible to get a good angle on it, hair removal creams were too weak for the hair but any stronger and they would have been to strong for my face, plus if I had a pimple or razor burn I couldn’t use them, and when I went in for laser hair removal they told me my skin was too dark for treatment.Years of shaving against the grain, (because with the grain never got a smooth enough shave) have caused significant discoloration on my chin and made it darker. I wouldn’t care about that since I can cover the color with concealer, but of course, even after shaving EVERY MORNING my hair would grow back by 4pm and leave me with 5 o clock shadow. To understand how well this product works, I need you to understand, these were THICK, BLACK, LONG hairs that grow straight out in a matter of hours. They are the most coarse hairs I have on my body, even including more personal areas, they are that wiry. Literally feels like a bottle brush coming out of my chin!On my wedding day I was worried I would have to hide a razor on me, sneak into the bathroom, shave, and reapply my chin makeup, it was SO bad. After two weeks of using this product at level 5 on my face, 3-4 times a week, I have been able to shave in the morning before treatment and not had to shave again until the next afternoon. TWO WEEKS and an issue I’ve dealt with for 15 years is improved. Even just having to shave only once a day instead of morning and night is a Godsend, but the idea that I could possibly one day have to shave less than that is incredible. I attached a picture so you could see what shade I am, and what shade my discolored chin is. The fact that the laser can tell the difference between my hair and my hyper-pigmented skin is incredible to me considering professionals turned me away when my chin wasn’t as dark. I took a chance on this device because it looked like my skin shade on my face was the absolute darkest it’s approved to be used on or a little darker.I have had laser treatments on a tattoo in the past and the person performing the treatments warned me on brown skin, discoloration can occur making your skin lighter or darker. For me it was worth the risk because I already had such significant discoloration, and it bothered me way less than the hair, which just made me feel like less of a woman. I have not noticed any color change one way or another from this laser, but I am taking pictures to see if there is a change and I will update this review if I notice anything since I know that is important to others.Bottom line: This device is easy to use, especially for small areas. I’m sure it will work on large areas as well, but it will certainly take some time. I originally was displeased with the tiny window because I think it will take my legs a looooong time to get done, but the window is exactly the right size for my upper lip and chin, so I think any bigger would not work. I don’t think the pain is too bad at power level 5, but I have not gone past this due to my skin tone. The fact that I have to shave HALF to a THIRD as often after only 6 uses is just insane.I say if you’re thinking about it, just do it! Especially if you’re just on the border of the “recommended skin tones” on the chart. I love, love, love this device and want to try it on my husband’s back hair soon! One million stars if I could. Thank you thank you thank you for helping me feel more like a woman again.",

From the moment I applied it, the cooling sensation was incredibly refreshing and soothing. It dried quickly, making it so easy to use, and peeling it off was both satisfying and effective.My skin felt instantly smoother and looked so much brighter after the first use. It does an amazing job of removing oil and impurities, leaving my pores deeply cleansed and noticeably minimized. I’ve also seen a huge improvement in my skin tone—thanks to the niacinamide, my complexion is more even and radiant.This mask truly delivers everything it promises, and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’re looking for clearer, healthier, and glowing skin, this is the one to try!",

Not only does it balance out your skin tone, moisturize and nourish the skin, minimize pores and wrinkles, brightens the skin, BUT IT ALSO CLEARS OUT BLACK-/WHITEHEADS???? it's literally all my skin products and masks put into one bottle T-T <3 It's a dream come true; a face mask that is truly a one-hit wonder <3 <3 <3 <3Although it might be worth mentioning that this stuff as a detoxifier is hardcore; the first day after using it, my face started to break out a bit, but only because it *continues* to bring out the toxins in your face. By day 2, my face was clearing up and looking pretty. And by day 3??? i literally looked 2yrs younger (i even got some compliments)!! As i've continued using the face mask over the past month or so since purchasing it, this remains consistent; your face looks better and better as the days pass, resulting to the skin becoming smooth and glossy like a k-pop star (just like the advertisement said it would) after a couple days!!Also worth mentioning that the mask is sticky and thick. Like with most masks, i used my face mask applicator tool thingy, but found that to be rather frustrating with this stuff :/ So now i instead simply wash my hands first, then apply the mask with my fingers; makes it a lot easier. Also, i found that even if i think i applied it on a bit too thick, it still dries the same so that's cool ^-^You should definitely buy this! You won't regret it!",

Das habe ich bis jetzt so nicht hinbekommen, da sich es sich um eine Peel Off Maske handelt, welche, nach spätestens 15 Minuten eine Bewegung der Gesichtsmuskeln nicht mehr möglich macht, wenn man nicht möchte, dass die Maske sich löst.Trotzdem eine gute Make, auch bei empfindlicher Haut.Der Preis ist natürlich nicht unbedingt günstig, ansonsten finde ich die Maske top.",

You need to use a fair bit to create a thick enough layer that doesn't break off into bits while removing it.2. It has a very strong, glue like smell. It's really overpowering and having to put so much on your face doesn't help.I'll keep using it but I'm not sure if the results I gain are significant enough to justify the cost and cons.",

I initially thought the glasses were gimmicky and wouldn’t work that well, but I was proven wrong! I can watch tv or read a book in bed without straining my neck! I’ve noticed my posture feels better b/c I’m no longer hunched over or in a weird position. Wearing them feels like I’m using a VR headset.Cons: my eyes do feel tired more quickly, so I’m unsure if I will get used to it or will atop using them b/c of this. They are also slightly too heavy, and are a little uncomfortable on my nose. They have left marks on my nose when I wear them for a little while.",

    "reviewText": "I have not tested it for a long time but you may initially feel a bit uncomfortable due to the middle of the glasses having a barrier between your eyes, so whatever you are looking at you will feel like each of your eyes are looking through binoculars with a division in between. You will however have \"no blind spot\" in the middle and your mind will stitch both images together giving you a full picture.The discomfort: Imagine if you had your hand in a karate chop position, now put that in between your two eyes. You will still see everything in front of you and the hand itself will not cause a blind spot but you will feel discomfort by the fact that the hand is in the middle of the two images. I do not know if will cause eye strain for other people but it caused me a little bit, perhaps it just takes some getting used to so I will not knock the product down much for it.For the manufacturer, it would be interesting if you guys produce a version where the eyes are not separated so the middle barrier/division is not present. (basically like a jordie laforge style)great concept, very good execution. perhaps version 2 will be perfect?",

    "reviewText": "First of all, I want to say that these are EXTREMELY cool. I have never seen anything like this and for someone who will lay in bed to binge watch an entire series on Netflix, these are super nifty for avoiding any kinks in your neck. I actually thought it was a fluke because there is no way you could watch a show clearly with something like this, but IT IS LEGIT. The image is a bit smaller though.Cons:- Heavy -- considering these are to be worn like glasses, they are relatively heavy and can be super uncomfortable if worn for too long, so it's not ideal for long-term use.- Vision impairment? I am not sure how to explain it, but since you're technically staring at a reflection, it kind of messes with your eyes, in my opinion. I am not sure how it is when reading, but if you wear them while watching tv, then it almost feels like you're going cross eyed. Again, only happens if you wear them for too long. I've actually used them before bed if I couldn't fall asleep because it almost makes your eyes feel droopy and tired...Overall, it's super inventive and a really unique product, and despite the cons, I would still recommend it considering how inexpensive it is! But if you are prone to getting headaches, I wouldn't buy it.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars less than ideal, best I can find",
    "reviewText": "I tried to make a picture of how it feels to look through these things. As a novelty, they work well, but for any serious reading, the tiny size of the viewing windows are a constant detriment. I would recommend you keep looking for a horizontal reading solution. The technology is not there yet. Larger prisms, a wider nose bridge, and more plastic material around the frame edges would improve these a lot.The prisms are quite small, measuring about 27mmx44mmx32mm; apparently, you're hard-pressed to find any silvered prisms larger than this, which is a real pity. With larger prisms and a larger viewing window, these could be great for reading books from a comfortable distance, and not with the text in line with ones nipples.This means that the actual portion of my field of view that the image takes up is not even 40%. This might be able to be improved, if the nose bridge were not so extremely narrow so that you cannot slide them all the way on your face. I do not have an exceptionally large nose, or maybe I do; I cannot put these on my face nearly far enough to close out all the exterior sights and shadows. I have worn large over-the-glasses shades before, and they shut out the light nicely around the edges of my vision. These are too small to do so. They are perched on my nose like Ben Franklin reading spectacles.There is ghosting on the viewing image, like when you put your face very near a mirror and can see a slight... ghostly image. This is probably unavoidable due to the nature of light refracting through a prism, but still detracts from the reading experience considerably when there is a superimposed mirror ghost image over the bottom half of the book. I have tried to show this in my mockup photo.There is an upside-down image above each eye, which is even more distracting than the superimposed ghost image. This does not seem to be avoidable either.They fit over my glasses nicely, which I didn't expect. That is nice, because in contrast to one reviewer's husband's experience, I CANNOT see in focus through these without my glasses.The sides of the prisms are shiny, and having three large vertical whitish bars is also rather distracting when reading. There might not be any way to make these less obtrusive, but a matte finish or different color or angle might improve this aspect.",

And they are NOT fashionable! They do, however, work great, and the price is very reasonable. Definitely recommend.",

    "reviewText": "I have fibromyalgia with near-constant back and neck pain, so I frequently lay down while working on my laptop at home. These have been such a *huge* help! Typing is tricky since the glasses kind of throw off my equilibrium a bit, but it’s still possible, and as long as what I’m doing is mostly reading and using the mouse, they’re wonderful. My husband tried to play Call of Duty with them out of curiosity, and the only problem was the equilibrium issue; he could see the TV just fine from the couch, he just couldn’t get the hang of playing in that position. In other words, looking through them is nearly identical to how you would normally see, just slightly smaller. The only “con” to these, if it’s bad enough to even be considered a con, is that the upper part of the glasses rests snugly across the forehead, so they leave a pretty deep indentation on my forehead after I take them off (not at all painful), and when I get too warm they can fog up. But that’s the only “issue” I can come up with. They’re really great!",

Nice and sturdy ...well built...awesome fit with regular seeing glasses.I'm very happy I bought these..I actually fell asleep faster and with them on hahaha. That's how comfortable they are.",

    "reviewText": "This review is for: Virtegasas Horizontal Lazy Glasses Bed Prism Spectacles Lazy Readers Glasses Periscope Eyeglasses Upgraded Prism Glasses - For Reading and Watching TV in Bed While Lying FlatGot these yesterday. Pretty wild! They really do work. I have to say that it's pretty wild how your vision is separated through these two tunnels and your eyes still put the two images together, perfectly, like it's one image. Just a fun anatomy thing, I guess.I tried them two ways, close up and more of a distance. Laid flat in bed and looked at my phone. Vivid and crystal clear, just as if you were looking directly at your phone. While you can see a little but of something down the center of your vision in a way, it doesn't interfere with the object you're looking at and you can still see it clearly.Then, while still laying flat in bed, I tried watching TV. My TV is on a wall that is probably about 13 feet or so from my eyes. Still, the image was clear and I could see it perfectly.The only reason for 4 stars is that in both cases, the image is smaller and seems farther away than it is. I think this is just the physics involved with the image being reflected and there is probably no avoiding it. It's not too bad, but it is very obvious that the image you're looking at is smaller and farther away, seemingly. Maybe it's not fair to dock the product if this illusion is unavoidable, but 5 stars on these might convey that they reflect the image just as if it would be if you were looking at it directly, but it does not.Price is very reasonable at (currently) $13.99.I feel that these could be extremely useful in certain circumstances where mobility is an issue! If someone had neck troubles, etc., this would be a great solution.If I could give these 4.2 or 4.5, I would.I hope this was helpful.",

    "reviewText": "I was actually excited to try this item, simply for the novelty of such a product and also because, well, let’s face it… I’m lazy. I’ve only used these glasses once or twice while laying bed so I could watch TV while also reading during the commercials, and I don’t think I’ll be keeping them because they aren’t really good for long-term, practical use.As far as ‘periscope’ vision goes, the glasses didn’t seem to provide as steep of an angle as I was expecting, therefore I was a bit disappointed.It was certainly interesting to try, but it felt a bit awkward wearing them and it was disorienting/dizzying and almost nauseating for me to have them on for more than a few minutes at a time. The glasses don’t exactly provide the crispest vision since you’re viewing a reflection of an image, so naturally it’s a bit discombobulating.And of course anyone wearing these looks absolutely ridiculous – I felt like I looked like Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob 😂So in summary, this would make a great gag gift or stocking stuffer as long as you don’t take it too seriously or expect too much from it.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars At first I thought that these were a joke, or a novelty item. Not so!",
    "reviewText": "I assumed that these were a joke when I first saw them. When I received them I realized that the joke was on me... because they actually work.These are a comfortable set of glasses with blacked out lenses. Mounted to the center of each is a large glass (I assume it's glass... they're heavy) prism. It's the prism, and the way it's been cut that allows you to see horizontally.Don't misunderstand... these will never be mistaken for some sort of \"spy\" eyewear. They're way too obvious. In fact, if people see you wearing these they'll immediately assume you're suffering from some dire handicap, and and are likely to offer to buy you a meal.I can wear these and look straight ahead, and still read what is in front of me on the table, in in my hands. These eliminate the need to crane your neck forward.I tried laying on the bed and on the couch, and reading with the book centered on my chest. Perfect!I even laid flat on the floor and read, with nothing propping up my head. Amazing.It's obvious to me that these would be perfect if you were to go to the beach (hopefully, a deserted beach) and laid flat on your towel, reading. In the case where you're on a normal beach with people around, expect lots of stares and giggling.Additionally, I can wear my reading glasses under these. It's still comfortable.So, any negatives? Yes, there is one. Because the prisms are glass and heavy, they make the glasses front-heavy. So if you're say, sitting at the table with them on, reading straight down, they are trying to pull away from your face. It's likely that's why they seem to imply that they're designed for laying down to read, for which they are, excellent.I really like these, but trust me, I won't be wearing them in the bleachers at the next Astros game.Very clever idea that actually works very well.",

    "reviewText": "I loved the original version but these are even better. The view is clear and does not make objects appear smaller and further away. I prefer the way these prism lens are sturdier and solid, have no framing issues, are easier to clean, and do not stick out as much which allow them to fit in a sunglass case. I use them every night when I lay down to read my kindle before bed and the comfy weight on my face also helps me fall asleep, as the original did. I have also used them to watch TV from bed and also while leaning back in my desk chair. I have gotten so used to wearing them that I very much dislike the eye muscle strain I feel when reading or watching something and I have to tilt my head or eyes.Edit: I use both the older version and this one depending on my mood for Kindle or phone light glare. This version of lazy glasses allows the light from your phone to be visible below the lens so if you are unfocused you may get distracted by the light visible below the lens. The original version with the black frames blocks this light so you only see through the lenses. I keep them both on my bedside table.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A must for \"tech-neck\" suffers",
    "reviewText": "A must for \"tech neck,\" sitting with your neck craned while using your phone or reading a book is terrible for your posture and causes your neck to move forward over time exacerbating the issue until your neck and shoulder muscles are in constantly pain. I've used a denneroll that was prescribed by my chiropractor in the past and while it helps, it forces to to stare at the ceiling for extended periods or hold a book/device directly over your face to keep you occupied (I don't know if any of you have dropped a phone on your face while doing this but it's not fun).With this I can use the denne roll and watch something that's playing on a TV or resting on my chest. Even better I've found these glasses can replace the use of a denne roll and I can instead stare at the ceiling while watching TV or other tasks from the couch and have my neck in the relaxed position.In addition it allows me to multitask throughout the day by having a book resting in my lap while at my computer, I can look through the lenses to read or write what's in my lap and then look over the top of my glasses like you would bifocals and be able to read and use my computer screens.Now, I would caution walking around the house with them on (I have on occasion but it takes some getting used to walking while staring at your feet and tilting your head from side to side while doing this can be very disorienting.I like this design over others that I have tried specifically because you can see over the top of the glasses by having them rest a little lower on your nose. The picture is still clear and it's easy to use. Very much recommend for those suffering from a pain in the neck or stiff trapezius muscles relating to posture.",

    "reviewText": "Ich hatte die Brille beim Optiker vor einiger Zeit probiert, aber da waren mir 150 ,- EUR für eine Lesebrille \"von der Stange\" etwas zu viel Geld. Jetzt ist der Preis etwas runter und in der Zwischenzeit habe ich wieder zwei Billigbrillen für rund 15,- EUR das Stück verschlissen. Es musste Ersatz her.Zur Erklärung: Ich benötige eine Brille nur zum Lesen und für den Nahbereich im Auto (Navi, Brodcomputer, etc.).Die Porsche Brille sitzt perfekt und man spürt sie kaum. Im Auto kann ich sie zum ablesen der Instrumente tragen ohne das mich das Darüberschauen für die Weitsicht bei der Fahrt stört. Das Material und die Verarbeitung sind Porsche typisch wertig - wie auch die Rodenstock Gläser. Zur Brille gab es ein Lederetui mit Magnetverschluss und Brillentuch. Der versand via Linsensuppe war flott.",

These stick on bifocals work on lenses with minimal curvature and great on flat lenses. Very clear on my flat lens sunglasses. I tried them on my wrap around sunglasses with a noticeable curve and they do not work/stick. So keep that in mind.That's probably why when I purchased 8+ years ago from Grainger they were listed with the safety goggles which have flat lens. Now you can find bifocal safety glasses that look like wrap arounds instead of the goggle type but hey are not bifocals and usually used for workplace.",

    "reviewText": "After cataract surgery I needed sunglasses with readers. Already had three pair of plain Maui Jim sunglasses and wasn’t looking forward to buying all new Maui Jim’s w’readers. Found these lenses by accident and thought for this price I’d try them. They install easily and the vision is better than expected. Main concern was they were a bit large, but the directions said they could be trimmed. Positioned the lenses where I wanted them, used an ultra fine point sharpie to mark the area sticking out below the lens and then slowly trimmed them with sharp small scissors. Worked like a charm and didn’t hamper the vision a bit. Like the idea of being able to switch lens power for reading, driving, etc. In a perfect world they could be a bit thinner, but that’s not as much of an issue after they’re cut down. Hope they sell a lot of these for a long time so they’ll be available down the road if needed.",

    "reviewText": "These bifocals stickers are good quality, rigid material, not flimsy and work great.......once you get them to adhere to your glasses. I ordered 2 sets and three of the stickers adhered fairly easily but the fourth one would not stay stuck. I had to reapply several times, which was easy to do, and the top edge of the sticker just will not stick. I finally decided it was as good as it was going to get and since I could still see thru the bifocal to read etc. I just quit trying to get it perfectly stuck. These are basically like putting a screen protector on your phone or tablet and have the same issues such as bubbles. There is also a definite right and wrong side to the sticker because they have a slight curve to them. If you have completely flat lenses on your glasses, not sure these would work. But once I got the stickers to adhere to my sunglasses they worked fine and I am happy with my purchase.",

    "reviewText": "I wasn't super optimistic given the many mixed reviews I've seen about whether these actually stick to your mask and make it through multiple mask defogging rinses.I followed the best directions I found on the web (not the packaging) to a tee - wash out the mask carefully with toothpaste/brush, rinse mask well & dry completely, soak the stick-on lenses in warm water, apply them to the inside bottom corners with the convex side pointing up/away from the mask lens (concave side down), press firmly in place and blot off any residual moisture, press firmly again, let dry overnight.I followed this procedure the day before I went diving in Thailand last December, and they stayed on just fine through defogging and mask clearing. Two dives that day, then three dives a few days later and they were still going strong. Worked perfectly! Could see my computer/guages and camera settings clearly, and marine life in the distance perfectly. Can see how it would be great for snorkeling masks as well. Made my diving experience perfect!",

I followed the directions as given - and I have a great pair of Ray Bans with flat lenses - they are just not 'sticking' like I had hoped. With a 2.50 magnification, they are also a little thicker than I had expected. They DO help with reading.Will they work in a pinch? Maybe......I'm a little nervous to wear them for fear the magnification lens will fall off. I purchased two sets - so I'll try them and see what happens. Not horribly confident, though.",

It works perfectly. I don't need to be propped up on a pillow to see the tv. I can lay on my back like normal, in a totally relaxed position and watch tv at the same time. The glasses are sturdy. They don't feel cheap at all. They have some weight to them. They work great! I was not disappointed with my purchase.",

I was tired of having to search my messy work area to find the other pair of glasses when I needed to change between reading my computer screen and being able to see what I was working on. That meant switching between some 1.5 glasses and and my 4.0. Since my search skills are horrible (I swear I can't find my own feet), this ate up a lot of time and patience.I love these! They are convenient and clear. They are easy to put on my drug store reading glasses. They work just like having two different pairs, without the searching pain.Yes, they are a little heavy. What would you expect. They don't have an anti-gravity mechanism to make them weightless. I had to tighten up the ear pieces on my 1.75's so the assembled pair wouldn't slide down my nose. But, they're not so heavy that they are uncomfortable.I need to get my wife her own pair for her beading work.",

There is a spring clip that you press open and position theses glasses over your regular lenses. All the parts that touch your lenses are covered in plastic or rubber. They stay in place and don't slip around. It is very easy to flip the lenses up when you don't need them. I am using them to read music on a music stand. My regular glasses are progressive bi-focals but the bi-focal is positioned at the bottom of the lenses and I can't use them unless it point my nose up to the ceiling. These clip-ons provide the additional magnification just where I need it. I have also used them for doing detailed craft, sewing and bead work.",

    "reviewText": "I bought these lenses in January 2018. It is now August 2018 & I need to replace them. So I got about 7 months of HEAVY use for just under $13 -- not bad at all, but not quite great.The glasses are reasonably scratch resistant. Fairly light in weight so... comfortable to use. I flip them up & down a lot -- down for reading, up for conversations & other activities. The spring holding the lens when flipped up is still working just fine. However, the spring that holds the lens in place when it is flipped down, so as to be against my glasses for reading purposes -- that spring has lost some power. As a result, the lenses \"sag\" away from my glasses, just a quarter inch or so, when I tilt my head to read or do cloose work. It's a minor annoyance but spoils my concentration at times. So I just bought a replacent pair of lenses.The lenses themselves are great. Flip lenses are a good idea for people who, like me, make frequent shifts between close work & other activities. With lighter use these lenses would surely last longer. Even so... 7 months of heavy use for under $13 -- I can live with that.Aloha to all from Hawaii.",

    "reviewText": "I find these days the glasses they make (progressive type) are great for distance, but your reading area is not magnified like with the older bifocals and the reading spot can be so small you have to move your head back and forth because you can't move your eyes.These clip on glasses fix all that! They offered me magnification I needed and a larger reading area when worn over my glasses. You need to buy the right number for you. Ask your doctor. 2.00 was what my doc said I needed over my glasses and it works perfectly. (You could probably also go to a store that sells reading glasses in the pharmacy area and try some on over your glasses to figure out what lets you read.)",

    "reviewText": "These clipon readers are perfect! The lens are excellent quality, just like prescription eyeglasses. The clips have rubber covers which prevent scratching your eyeglasses. The clip is strong and keeps the readers firmly in place even if you are moving around. The readers flip up when you don’t need them and still stay firmly attached and the clipping mechanism is small and doesn’t impede your line of sight. The readers come with a soft, good quality case. These are the best quality clipon readers I have ever used. They fit over my very thick prescription lenses.",

It's truly remarkable how they effortlessly adapt to my surroundings, allowing me to move freely without the need to constantly remove them and experience dizziness. The fact that these glasses adjust according to my eyesight is simply mind-blowing. I'm pleasantly surprised by how they can accommodate both my husband and me, despite our different prescription strengths. It's incredibly convenient and promotes sharing. Moreover, the design, with its sleek and round style, not only caters to my visual needs but also exudes a sense of versatility that suits both genders. These glasses truly encompass everything I desire in eyewear.",

I have a bad eye due to some surgery and it refracted all over the place, and regular reading glasses barely help focus it back, but this thing totally does it :) AND, it is SHARPER with full power focus and clarity than anything I've ever put on my eyes. Amazing! Takes a bit of getting used to, but it somehow works for my close and intermediate distances (I've had cornea thinned out due to a ton of Lasik, PRK, etc.) and thus sometimes even need reading glasses to see in the distance, strangely enough. The bridge of the nose fits perfectly, too, it doesn't need those weird nose bridge devices. And it doesn't stain the glasses (especially the upper) like regular glass-made prescriptions or off-the-shelf readers. Simply amazing!",

I gave the third pair to a friend who had stopped by and I asked her to read a short piece. I said 'try these'. She was impressed.By the way they are very comfortable and are quite sturdy.",

I don't know what 'multi flex' is supposed to mean, but I can tell you there is NO focus dial. As far as I can tell they are plain 2.5 strength readers, which, for me, is way too strong.

I was so worried I was going to cut the glasses and I came VERY close to getting the cord. Glasses are not as bright as I was hoping for/expected. Glasses are not as crisp as expected.However, they do work well for the price. I highly recommend upgrading packaging. I would give you an extra star if ANY of the above were better. But it would be too much effort to return them at this point. <shrug>",

    "reviewText": "Got some prescription readers -- very expensive. They work only in a band just in front of your eyes, which means your head has to be in a certain relationship to the material. This is a problem -- I often lay down in bed with my computer on my chest, which made it hard to get to the proper angle. These glasses look good and can be used at any angle. Much better for me. The only downside is that if you want to shift your gaze to distance you have to take them off, can't simply look over the prescription area.",

Maybe my nose or face is too thin for the glasses not sure. For me the nose arch could be thinner to stay up higher on my nose and face. I’m going to try to get used to them, because the are pretty. Also they come with a small amount of accessories like a neck cord, and a lens wiping cloth.",

Unfortunately, the magnifying strength of the lens is a bit weak. I ordered a 2.0 lens and received them labelled at 2.0, but they seem closer to a 1.75, meaning they're a bit soft in terms of focus.",

The lenses are crystal-clear, with NO reflections whatsoever. Everything is very much in FOCUS! I just wish the arms were a bit more substantial.. because as they are, they are just thin wire-like arms. So I have to handle these with utmost care, because they seem very delicate. So I keep them in the case whenever I'm not using them (or in the shirt pocket). Otherwise, I do recommend these Nice glasses.",

    "reviewText": "I like to work on crafts and my aging eyes make having reading glasses essential to being able to see close up. Adequate lighting is also important. The Lighted Reading Glasses seemed like the perfect combo. The glasses come with their own storage bags and cleaning cloths. The set also includes extra batteries which is a nice addition. Over all the glasses feel cheaply made. The frames are fairly flexible and feel like they would break without much effort. The lights however are bright and do light up the space right in front of them. The lights work independently from each other allowing the wearer to use either light alone or both together. The on/off switch is a little switch the sticks out on the underside of the arms and is moved back and forth from the on and off position. These will work nicely for up close crafting, but I don't think they will replace my usual cheap dollar store readers for every day use.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I decided to give these magnified readers a try to see if they might be a good option for reading or working on an art project in bed while my partner is sleeping and not wanting to disturb them.I didn't expect much but these exceeded my expectations. They are bright wherever I am looking but are not bright off to the side. A light on each side behind the hinge has a small switch to turn the light on and off. One light is more than sufficient for most tasks.The temples are a bit bulky, especially near the hinge they aren't something I notice in my field of vision or feel any noticeable weight difference when wearing. The frames feel like low-quality plastic so I don't expect them to hold up long term. The magnification works well and surprised me as I always find this to be the biggest issue with magnified readers. I don't find myself straining or sitting closer or further away than I do with my regular readers. Each pair comes with a nice drawstring eyeglass case, too. It's a decent set if you're looking for this type of feature.",

They are perfect for reading but bifocal glasses were not made for computer work for me need full vision. The frames are study and well made and not cheap light weight material. The glass is of course plastic and not blurring just has a light yellow cast at distance. I guess blue ray whatever, makes greens a little greener. Of course you will have to take the glasses off and on several times to catch the difference in the colors.I love being able to set and read, go to bathroom and look out my front door while wearing the glasses. Saves all the frustration not being able to find my glasses every time I take them off.......I would buy them again and suggest them to anyone and they are worth more than I paid for them. Will be trying the shades on my cruise next week.",

I've typically gone with the standard readers, slid down on my nose so I can look over them.These AQWANO Bifocal Reading Glasses are great because I can wear them like regular glasses. The lenses are large enough that there is good separation between the un-magnified upper portion, and the lower magnified part.Looking straight ahead at my computer screen or farther, the clear lens does not interfere with normal vision. But look down at my phone or reading material, and the magnified part is right where I need it.I've tried progressive bifocals for comparison, and I just can't get used to the blurry transition area. At least these ones have a clear cut distinction between the magnified and un-magnified parts of the lens. Very easy to wear and use.",

The reading focal area is way too low, which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to use. The focus area is oddly positioned and doesn’t blend well with the rest of the frame, making it look unattractive. While they’ll do in an emergency, the quality just isn’t there. I ended up switching to a different brand with progressive lenses for a much better experience.",

Some were too small, others not clear vision or cheap and fell apart. Out of the box these are the best of the bunch. I've got the 1.5s.. perfect vision distance wise and close up with a wide field of vision. But this is the first day. If these fall apart like others say they do I'm coming back and trashing them and dropping some stars lol.",

These particular frames are much better than I had expected. I was expecting fairly poor quality, but good enough to try at such a low price. If I had not liked them or if progressives did not work for me, I would not have felt badly about the cost. However, they are cute, don't slip off my face, and seem well-made. I will be buying another set! No need for more expensive frames, Recommend.Update: afterwards I realized I had ordered the wrong magnification. Exchange was very easy and now I have the correct magnification. Appreciated the great customer service!",

I also use a 2.50 for tiny work but I don't wear them regularly. I'm an EH&S manager so I'm always changing safety glasses depending on the situation with which I have to contend and most of my glasses are ANZI diopters. I thought these might be perfect for office work.These are so close but the focal length is strange. I ordered the 1.5's thinking the 1.5 would be on the bottom and digress as your eyes moved up the lens. The top part of the glasses is about a .5. I'm not sure what the middle is but I suspect it's supposed to be somewhere between a .75 to and 1. I find myself nodding up-and-down and moving back-and-forth trying to find the prefect spot for what I am doing. Even still, I can't seem to get a clear picture and the computer font can look doubled.I'm typing on my PC now (obviously) and I've just reverted back to my trusty, basic 1.0's, positioned close to the end of my nose and do the over-the-top-of-the-fame-peek when someone comes to the door.",

As a real PLUS, they also have a slight yellow tint to help block blue light from those same screens, fluorescent lights, or plain old sunshine.I actually would have happily paid $15 a piece for these quality progressive readers, but to get 3 pair for $15 is a really great bargain.

    "reviewText": "Ok. So. My neck was killing me around Christmas time, like AWFUL NECK PAIN that caused dizziness and pressure and nausea etc. and I noticed that it was worse and maybe completely exacerbated by the position I was holding my head and neck at, in order to look at my phone! (Ouch! Both in bed, and while sitting or standing). So I started looking for these type of glasses that I could use to help with my neck pain. These are awesome!!! I experienced so much relief with them!!! When you wear them your neck automatically goes to the correct anatomical position with a nice normal cervical curve (no pain!!) it’s seriously amazing. I loved it so much I bought 5 more for all my immediate family members for Christmas! This is 2 of them, using them immediately and also LOVING THEM. Notice their neck position ;) perfect C-curve!! I should add that I’m also a Chiropractic intern (Dr. In 1.5 months) and I already recommend it to my patients in clinic and to anyone who complains of neck pain to me!The lenses are really clear and a tiny bit magnified!They also fit over reading glassesThey are perfectLove themMy neck was saved. Text neck is no joke. And it causes sooo many problems outside of just neck pain.Buy this. And experience relief when doing anything on your lap or on a table. Like homework, sewing, reading, sudoku, anything. And especially use in bed when scrolling on the phone!!!",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Major Update: These frames SNAPPED in only a week while carefully attempting to adjust 1 arm.",
    "reviewText": "I have worn prescription eyeglasses for years and have had to adjust the arm ‘width’ (slowly, gradually and carefully) many times. I also know when I cannot make the adjustment myself and require professional assistance. I attempted a minor single arm procedure on these so they would not slide forward when I lean forward. And they snapped at the left lens holding area where no adjustment was being attempted.The natural tortoise colour I selected is a quite handsome frame. Their magnification might be a tad more than their spec, but if so it seems to make them even better readers for me. You need to know that the round lens size is small, but John Lennon would probably have loved them. I enjoyed having them sitting quite comfortably towards the end of my nose to allow an easy switch from the TV to lap computer without missing a beat. Larger lens/frames would not allow for this wearing option so they have a distinct advantage for me. I have mentioned elsewhere I have come to regard reading glasses from Amazon as expendable throwaways. Since they cost so little and look so good, I just try to have an extra pair on hand. Usually something different to try. But that was when I got at least several months wear from them…not just a week or 2. I think I’m glad in any event that I only wear them to read at home, or after arrival at a destination requiring reading. I’m sure I would not want the obvious risks associated with a deploying airbag while wearing them. -max",

I thought this was normal except when I tell the eye dr. this they don't seem to get it. I tried expensive perscription sunglasses, etc but the curved sport lenses seemed to be blurry so I gave up and just went with cheaters. I tried tons of different 1.25 cheater sunglasses and safety glasses for riding my dirt bikes and none had clear lenses so I had to stick to something simple like these and they work well for non sunglasses. The blue light filter works great and are like mild sunglasses and I do feel like they relax my eyes more and cause less fatigue.",

I searched for something like this on Amazon and there they were! I figured for ten bucks, about the price of a Big Mac now, I could try these.Well, they arrived and I tried them and WOW, they work perfectly. I can lie with my head against the pillow and watch TV or look at my laptop computer. After a few days the pain in my neck started to subside.They are kind of bulky and feel weird at first, but they do what they say they'll do.",

    "reviewText": "I have about a dozen pair of readers...I can't see near at all after my catarct surgery. It's such a pain to constantly take readers on and off, and of course I'm always forgetting where I put them! These glasses do it all. They have a small section on the lower part for magnification. BUT, they also turn into sunglasses outside. Amazing! See the picture. They are not the darkest tint, but they do the trick. Just ordered a second pair. The price is affordable. Really feel like I've found the solutin for seeing both near and far, not needing to also carry sunglasses as well. I believe they are blue light blocking too. Very happy I found these!",

Also the bifocal line is really pronounced right in the middle of my eyeline - and maybe that's just the size of my face I have a smaller head.

    "reviewText": "I wanted a very lightweight pair of glasses to wear for various reasons at different times outside of my normal prescriptions. For example my prescription glasses are a little heavier I just needed something that I could read with at night and I didn't need to be concerned with distance. These glasses are perfect for my night time reading habit in bed but they look amazing enough to wear all day long out in public. If you are looking for a pair of glasses that feels light as a feather but yet cute is a button these are it! They have been very durable despite their light weightness. And I just love the little hint of color on the arms.",

The replacement pair seems fine in that regard. My issues are not major but are perhaps more about how I need for them to work. The bifocal part is fine...but the clear portion of the lense above the bifocal is if anything distracting. Granted, at this price I don't expect perfect optical clarity but they just seem to not be in the right spot all the time. As for comfort, they seem to be a little tight on the back of my ears but I'm betting an adjustment will help with that. Again...this is probably more me and what I need for them to do. They are extremely light weight, seem to be made well, and for the bifocal part are great...",

It took aome time to adjust to those. After some time I observed that neither my close neither my distant vision is clear, as it should. And that was prescribed by ophthalmologist.So, I took things in my hands and started to try new things.I wear these byfocal for the last 6 months and they are the most comfortable I have ever had.

However, when I last tried to use them, I pulled them out of my purse pocket to find them broken. They had snapped over the bridge of the nose.Oh well.

    "reviewText": "I ordered this DeLonghi 14,000 BTU air conditioner with UV-Carelight on August 11th 2021 and it cooled quickly in a 92 degree large open space. But, as you can see from the photo, it now sits outside with a cut cord waiting to go to the dump.In October I turned on the unit for its UV properties and it worked for a couple of days until the fan started to make a loud screeching sound. I unplugged the unit and called DeLonghi Customer Service (CS) who asked me to make a video of the fan noise so they could evaluate the problem. I could not duplicate the problem, so I didn't send the video assuming it had self-corrected..In June 2022 (after just a few days of AC use when I bought it) I set up the unit and turned on the air conditioner. The fan blew air, but the compressor never turned on and the unit went off and on at will. It blew hot air!I called customer service with the reasonable assumption that DeLonghi would send a new replacement. I provided a video and cut the cord as instructed since they don't retrieve broken air conditioners. However, although 100% on my side, CS said the Company's policy is to replace the unit with a reconditioned one that may or may not be the same color or have the same features, and whose warranty continues with the existing purchase.CS contacted his manager at my request for a new unit with new warranty because it was used less than a month, and the answer was \"no.\" I asked him whether there was someone else who could evaluate the situation and that person said OK to a new unit, same as I bought, but warranty continues from original purchase date. There were no refurbished machines available. The CS and I agreed this is the best we could do so I compromised. CS said he would follow through so the process moves ASAP and I'm sure to get a new unit. Since DeLonghi doesn't accept returns of broken units I asked CS how they get the A/Cs for refurbishments. In the worst-possible consumer scenario, where do the refurbs come from?? Well, they're the ones that \"fall\" off the truck when being delivered and therefore not accepted by the customer. Dings and bangs. Yup!!WHAT???!!! I just spent $645 for this barely-used air conditioner (minus money Amazon reimbursed me to buy dust covers that were advertised [at the time] as included but neither Amazon CS nor I could convince DeLonghi to send them) and countless h-o-u-r-s searching Amazon for the right free-standing air conditioner to meet our needs.A week later I received a notice that the label was created for \"new\" AC from DeLonghi. At this writing, it's two weeks and no sign of shipment. By now, the temperature in the Great Room is close to 90 degrees. So...I call Amazon CS and within 20 minutes I've 'returned' the AC and received a refund so this week I will have a functional AC and maybe two for a second room. Amazon Customer Service Rocks! It may be the last vestige of Corporate customer service.",

    "reviewText": "Condo is about 1k SF, long and narrow, 1 floor with 3 bdrms/1 bath. I have 1 unit at the back of the unit near kitchen and aimed down long hallway which is center of unit. I had to wait for a week of excessive heat warnings to review to see how this handled Chicago heat index over 100 degrees with 80+% humidity. It's great.Setup: The unit is VERY easy to setup. The manual wasn't as in depth as I would have liked, but the unit works well.Dehumidifier: releases the water captured out the hose connected to the window, so there is no manual disposing of water like I have had in other dehumidifiers. It also cools as if in a/c mode while it is removing the water from the air.A/C: I like the ability to adjust where the air hits, has good angle to make the entire room / space comfortable. There is no jerky loud noise like you get with a window unit as the unit cycles on/off to regulate temperature.Cons:1. You set the temp you want, but the unit doesn't tell you what the current temperature or humidity % is or how close your unit is getting to the set #.2. I'm not sure if this unit is going to tell me when to clean the filters or if I just need to manually do it every so often.These aren't that significant to me though and the ease of no longer lifting a super heavy window unit in/out of a frame is great.",

    "reviewText": "Dear Prospective Owner of this De'Longhi A/C,(cue background music:) ♪ It's like a heat wave ♪I purchased this through Amazon, although it can be cheaper bought directly, but I wanted it sooner and, frankly, Amazon can be better with deliveries and returns, imho.Don't be fooled by the strapping young lad who carries this over his shoulder to your door-step. This is frick'n heavy. I couldn't lift the box to carry it inside. What ever protein shakes and such that they are doing to these Amazon delivery guys.. I don't know.So, thankfully, this device has wheels, so unboxing it where it is and pushing it where you need it to be is a huge plus.OK, now I only found this out after it was delivered and turned on... if this had a chance of being shipped on its side or whatever and not upright. LET IT REST UPRIGHT for at least 6 hours before turning on so the oil can filter back down to the compressor. Or else, you might ruin the compressor. (I did not have this prob, it's just noted in the manual.)Now that you have burnt 3,000 cal man-handling this contraption into place and removed all the weird tape and shtuff on it. It has to be vented. Shorter distance the better. I have an old pet door (RIP Spanky the monkey!) that hasn't been used in years that happens to be a convenient exhaust portal.Thankfully, unless in a humid environment, you don't have to do trips to the whatevers to do repeated emptying of a water bucket. It self-evaporates. 👏 👏 👏This contraption blows air almost straight up.. which can be a bit annoying, depending on the deployment of said contraption. But, it is effective, albeit loud like any A/C unit.PROS:- Sort of looks like a Penguin if you squint your eyes a bit.- Cools well, albeit, you have to be patient, but it's like any other A/C of this range.- Has wheels!- NO EMPTYING BUCKETS, this is actually pretty neat. Last unit I had needed a lot of maintenance.- Remote is a little bit of a gimmick and not always reliable, but cool (pun intended)CONS:- Heavy. Like, you seriously might need help getting this into place if you aren't in the WWE or work for Amazon Freight™.- Points air UP, which, I know the ceiling could use a little more attention, but you might end up using the excessive packaging cardboard to fashion a 90 degree duct to blow the air where you want. (seriously)- Kind of expensive, but relatively OK for gadgets in this genre.4.5/5",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Buyer Beware! These units crack and leak at the bottom!",
    "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews, but I'm doing this out of a sense of responsibility. These De'Longhi ACs have a major design flaw that will result in your floors being flooded and damaged. The worst part is, that De'Longhi is well aware of this problem and continues to ship the product.My photos here basically tell the story. These units are designed to literally sit on the plastic water tank. Instead of having a metal bottom with casters (and the tank inside the unit), the tank is directly at the bottom of the unit and the casters are attached to it. This results in a lot of pressure and stress on the plastic, mostly from the weight of the unit, but also due to how the plastic is attached internally.As you can see this results in the plastic cracking, which allows the water in the tank to pour out. These units produce a lot of condensation, and it only takes a few hours of running to flood your floors. I discovered this the hard way. We had so much water leak out of this tank that it drenched our carpet and the subfloor. It actually damaged our house, and we spent a week trying to dry the carpet and padding out. We probably have mold now as a result.These units are literally shipping out with this defect. It arrived at my home this way, but we didn't know because the crack was underneath. It wasn't until our floor had been soaked numerous times that we realized there was a major problem. By the time the crack was discovered, the damage had been done.This is not an isolated incident. If you read through the reviews here you'll see this is a common and known issue. In fact, when I contacted De'Longhi support about this it was obvious that they had many customers with the same problem. They shipped me out a replacement under the warranty, and guess what, it has the same problem!Look at the last two photos I've attached, and you'll see there are stress marks (white marks) in the plastic in the identical location of the unit that had the crack. This replacement unit has the same problem, and is a ticking time bomb waiting to crack in the same location.This is a stupid design flaw on an otherwise very nice unit. Why they are not making these with metal bottoms is beyond me. My guess is they are being very cheap about it. I have another De'Longhi AC from years ago, and it also has a plastic bottom. My guess is they are saving more money than they are losing from this issue.Dealing with De'Longhi support is a nightmare. You will spend at least 30-45 minutes on hold. When you finally get someone they will only offer a replacement. They will not refund under any circumstance. In my case they offered me a 4th unit and I laughed. I've had 3 defective units from De'Longhi. The first one shipped out with an assembly defect in the outer casing. The second one had the cracked bottom, and the third unit has the stress cracks in the same spot.By the time you realize you have an issue your only choice is to go through De'Longhi support. Amazon will not refund past 30 days. In my case I've had 4 months of replacements and no one will refund me, not De'Longhi or Amazon. I'm left with a unit that will likely split open at the bottom in a matter of days or weeks.De'Longhi does not care about their customers. I've spoken with them many times, and it is clear they only care about their bottom line. They are basically committing fraud here by shipping these units out with clear knowledge they crack and leak. They just don't care!They also have an absurd policy that requires you to cut the power cord on replaced units and send that photo to them in order for the warranty to be maintained on the replacement. This forces you to then pay to dispose of the defective unit. In my case I just glued the plastic bottom using a plastic epoxy and then sold the repaired unit. I just couldn't throw out a unit that was working perfectly except for the crack. What a waste that would be!If you do end up in my situation you can repair the cracked plastic by using J-B Weld PlasticWeld Super Strength Epoxy (sold by Ace Hardware). It will completely seal the crack and dries harder than the original plastic.Beyond that, I recommend staying away from De'Longhi and these AC units in particular (unless you prefer cracks and leaks).De'Longhi, shame on you for this!",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the DeLonghi Portable Air Conditioner 14,000 BTU (model EX390LVYN), and so far, it has exceeded my expectations. This unit is designed to cool extra-large rooms up to 700 square feet, but it has comfortably cooled my house with ease.In terms of performance, the air conditioner handles the job effortlessly, even in the sweltering heat. The cooling efficiency is impressive, making my home bearable and comfortable during these hot days. The energy-saving mode is a nice touch, helping to keep utility bills in check while maintaining a pleasant indoor climate.I also invested in an insulating sleeve for the hose, which was recommended by other users. It turns out to be a necessary addition, as the hose can get quite hot. The sleeve helps manage this heat effectively, ensuring that the unit runs efficiently. For those interested you can also purchase this item from Amazon (De'Longhi DLSA003 Portable Air Conditioner Exhaust Hose Cover/Wrap, Insulated, Universal, Light Gray).Overall, I’m very pleased with its performance. It has lived up to its promises and has made a significant difference in managing indoor temperatures. If you’re in the market for a portable air conditioner that combines cooling power with quiet operation, this DeLonghi model is a solid choice.",

    "reviewText": "Pros: works fantastic at cooling my bedroom, especially at night. Sleeping is fantastic with it so cool. My apartment is 730 sq ft and it does bring temp down outside my bedroom to some degree too and even further with the use of fans. Moves around easily on wheels. Pretty compact even with its size. Easy to assemble and doesn't take long to cool the area at all. Remote works great. I can set timer for it to start before I get home from work so apartment is cooler. Comes with a cover for the remote, and for the air conditioner, when I store it. Sleek and easy instructions with buttons to navigate the temp up or down. Has three options for use: air conditioning, fan or dehumidifier. I'm super happy I got it regardless that it cost a pretty penny. Very grateful!!!! Would do it again 😜Cons: hose was too short, only 4 ft I had to order another hose off Amazon as Canadian Tire, Lowe's, and Walmart didn't carry hoses. It cost me another $45 for a 4' 11\" hose 5.9\" round which works great but was not impressed that I had to pay more for another hose. Although it says it can cool 700 sq ft - I think it means one big room that's 700 sq ft as my apartment is 730 sq ft and it doesn't cool like it does in my bedroom outside of the bedroom. It brings the temp down to some degree outside the bedroom and fans help with the rest of the area however it works great if you're in the same roomor close there by.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptionally Good Portable with only Minor Design Quibbles",
    "reviewText": "I've had three previous portable ACs. This Whynter is the best so far!For a start, it has dual hoses. That may initially seem to fall somewhere on the scale between \"so what\" and \"what a pain\", but you actually WANT dual hoses. Here's why:Normal air conditioners are installed with part of the unit inside (think of it as 'the cold part') and part of the unit outside (or 'the hot part'). The 'hot part' contains the compressor -- similar to the engine of a car. It provides the power for the machine but, in so doing, generates a lot of heat that has to be removed somehow. The 'hot part' is cooled by the movement of air. It is said to 'breathe' because it takes in cooler air and expels warmer air.When you have a single hose portable unit, that hose is only used for 'exhaling' the hot air. That means that the 'inhaled' air to cool the mechanics will have to come from your room. So the air that you're paying to cool is being used to, in turn, cool the motor and then being 'exhaled' out that single hose in the window. Because it is constantly drawing air from the room and expelling it via the hose, a single-hose unit will create a vacuum in the room you're trying to cool. This means that doors won't really want to close, much of the air-conditioned air is being expelled and your home will begin to draw in the hot air from outside in order to equalize the interior air pressure.Dual-hose units, however, have one hose dedicated to each part of the 'breathing' cycle - one hose for 'inhale' and one for 'exhale'. That means that your air-conditioned air stays put right in the room you're trying to cool, and that's a Good Thing(tm). The result for me is that -- while I live in a top floor, full-sun-all-day apartment in a breezeless section of Los Angeles (a.k.a. \"a Broiler\") -- my bedroom now stays shockingly cold and I wind up turning this unit off in the middle of the night to avoid frost bite. Other (single hose) units had to run 24x7 through the warmer months just to keep the room livable. Comfortable was never an option.What's more, the Whynter is a much quieter machine than I've had before. You have to understand that there is no such thing as a \"quiet\" portable AC (because the 'hot part' is in your personal space). So if you're trying to maintain library silence, this will not work for you. It is louder than a fan but still MUCH quieter than any previous portables I've owned.I also like that Whynter eschewed silly and unnecessary moving parts (motorized louvers, for example). Those things always broke within weeks of heavy use anyway and eventually caused rattling annoyance as I waited for the previous machines to die.All air conditioners create condensation -- moisture that collects from the humidity in the air on the cooled internal parts of the machine. It's why you always see window air conditioners dripping -- they're expelling condensate. This unit collects that condensation in an internal tank, heats it up and evaporates it out the 'exhale' hose so that -- in all but the most humid conditions -- you never have to empty the bucket. That is also a Good Thing(tm); however, all units will need to be drained at some point if you use them long enough and in a wide enough variety of weather patterns. Most portable ACs seem to have considered placement of the drain plug in an \"Oh crap! We forgot the drain plug!\" kind of way. But the Whynter has the drain situated conveniently on the back of the unit, and high enough off of the ground that you don't wind up having to dig into the carpet to unscrew it. My previous unit's drain plug was mounted so low that when placed on carpet it became entirely inaccessible. That won't be a problem with the Whynter.Whynter's remote control is perhaps the best I've seen for a portable AC. It has its own little LCD display to show you the current state of the machine that stays wirelessly in sync with what is happening at the unit. So if you use the unit to turn the temp to 75F, for example, the remote will also show a target temp of 75F. That's a neat feature that means you can lay in bed, grab the remote and know how you want to adjust it based on its current state. This is yet another Good Thing(tm). But it could be a bit better. If the LCD glowed at night when you press a button so you can read it without turning on a light, that would be helpful. It would also be nicer if the keys had a more distinctive feel that would allow you to grab it in a dark room, find the button you want by touch and adjust the unit quickly. As it is, you have to have some external light source to be able to see what the remote is telling you.I've also previously had portable ACs that were clearly channeling Vegas when they designed their onboard LCD displays. Nobody wants an \"All Singing! All Dancing!\" animated LCD mere feet from where they're trying to sleep. Fortunately, the Whynter's display is just a placid blue with simple to read black characters. Much less obtrusive but, again, it isn't perfect. For a start, the LCD is positioned on the front of the unit instead of on the top. If you happen to be no more than 24\" tall then it is right at eye level. But if you're taller than that you'll need to take a knee or a seat to see the LCD. A position on top of the unit would have been a much better design choice. Also, the LCD is backlit whenever the unit is running and that isn't something you can change. You're just going to have a blue light in the room when the unit is on, full stop. And when the unit is turned off but you still need the display (like when you're setting the timer function to turn the unit on later in the day), the LCD doesn't light up so it is difficult to impossible to read without a flashlight. My preference would be that the LCD only lights up when you press a button, then turns off after a few seconds so you can have a dark AND cool room. My quick hack solution was to affix a piece of cloth that hangs down over the display, but that disables the remote control (because the receiver is somewhere in/around that display). So I can either have a dark room or a remote controllable AC. That is sub-optimal.On balance, I still give this a 5-star review because it just does what you want it to do -- cool the room -- and it does it very well. Its comparative quiet operation, dual hose configuration and exceptional cooling prowess far outweigh the little design quibbles I have with the unit. Especially when you consider that the next step up in machine design/quality/power (Movencool) is six times the price of this unit! Plus the Amazon Prime shipping? It's a no brainer. This is the unit you want.",

    "reviewText": "In late July we moved from long term housesitting with central air to a house that did not. Now this new place had a lot of space, was on a larger plot of land, and had many advantages.It was an older home, built in the 1940s originally and added on since, making it a ranch style home, with a living area at one end, and a nice office at the other. The office used to be an enclosed porch that they, a long while back, enclosed some more, but not at all what would be standard workmanship for today. The windows are almost all louvered in the house. There are high ceiling throughout, in every room but the office.It's a great house, just not a great house in hot weather because there's just no good way of cooling this place down. We're not the owners so can't do the kind of insulation additions that would be needed. There was a smaller window air conditioner in the bedroom, but that was it.Moving in late July meant, of course, that we were moving at the beginning of the hottest time of year.I had a dissertation to finish writing before September. I needed to work in the office. I got this.Well, set up was extremely easy. Got all the tape and packaging off, plugged in the hoses, put the vent panel over the window. It didn't fit all that well, but of course windows are all made differently so making it fit for a particular window is to be expected. When I put it in, it was already hot, so I used a liberal amount of duct tape (white) to seal it in on both sides.Turned it on. It started working. Pumped out a lot of cold air after a few minutes. Was wonderful to stand in front of.The trouble was that this room was a hotbox. The relatively low ceilings and all day direct sun made it crazy hot. There's no insulation. The louvered windows leak air like sieves. The Whynter shoots the air straight up, to cool the room not a particular spot. But, the room cooling effect wasn't working--it was the room not the Whynter. The room was definitely cooler with the unit on than off, even on 100+ degree days. But it only got about 10 degrees colder, and when it's crazy hot outside, the room is trying to heat up to a fair bit more than the outside temp, so the Whynter had a lot of work to do, and it wasn't able to pull it off.I got a Model 50 Premium Unbreakable Air Deflector, got it taped on (packing tape works and is mostly invisible), and got the air pointed right at me. Made all the difference. I could happily keep working no matter how hot it got outside or in the rest of the room.Found the window unit in the bedroom not cooling that room. It just wasn't strong enough for the rooms lack of insulation and high sloped roof. The room was, however, sealed well, so I put this Whytner in there, so that my wife and baby could have cool days while I was off to work.That's where this really proved itself. It kept the room in the upper 70s and low 80s even though it was about 100 degrees outside (and 104 in our living room. So much stronger and more powerful in every way.I live in California where the heat tends to be dry, so I've never had to mess around with the water pan. And while other reviews suggest that the heater isn't worth it, it really never gets all that cold here in California, so this is the perfect kind of heater for here, strong enough to heat up a room when the morning temps can get into the 40s or 50s (only very occasionally dipping down into the 30s).I'm exceedingly pleased by this, by it's versatility, ease of use, and portability. Moving it from one room to another is a snap (though I'm a big, strongish guy so picking it up in a few spots is easy for me).My one complaint is that the manufacturer attachments are really, surprisingly expensive. Much cheaper to build and fashion to size using basic materials and tools.",

    "reviewTitle": "This Air Conditioner is Well Designed & Reliable",
    "reviewText": "The brand name, Whynter, was unknown to me, so I felt we were taking a chance in buying it. But we are very impressed with this product, which is well designed, with excellent quality control and reliable performance.We use both the heating and cooling features equally as much - and both modes are very effective. As a dehumidifier, the lack of a humidity target setting means we use our dedicated dehumidifiers instead. But if you didn't have a separate dehumidifier, this feature would be useful.Like all appliances that use an air compressor, the unit produces a fair bit of noise. Only an exterior, non-portable air conditioner would reduce this inherent noise problem. But for many users, exterior or window-insert type air conditioners are simply not practical. In our case, exposing an air conditioner to the hostile exterior environment would mean that the unit would not last very long.The two hose design makes the product very efficient, and most of the competition want a lot more money for this feature. Because of outside air having poor air quality in this area, we typically do not have the intake actually drawing in outside air, but using interior air instead (without the second hose). Thus we affectionately call our AC unit, the \"Elephant in the Room\".",

    "reviewText": "I did a lot of research before deciding which portable air conditioner to go with, and I am soooo happy with this machine. At first I was looking at single hose units, but after reading some articles I discovered that dual hose are much more efficient. It's big, but it's sleek looking and works like a charm. Also, I am very sensitive to sound, so I was concerned it would be too loud for me. It's not quiet, of course, but the tone is lower rather than high pitch, so it's more like white noise. It doesn't bother my ears. I haven't tried the heat option yet since we are in the middle of a heat wave, but I am super happy sitting inside my cool apartment, with the nice clean air it's creating from adding the 3M filter. Very good investment.",

    "reviewText": "Just received this unit.. big & heavy, but it sure does cool nicely! I am using it in a small bedroom and it can make the room chilly in a matter of minutes.CONS:- Air conditioning mode requires the fan running 24 hours a day. Doesn't matter if the A/C is only active 1 hour a day. You can't turn the fan off. I was hoping for something like a hotel air conditioning unit. Kicks in & makes noise while cooling (a small price to pay) but then remains silent the rest of the time. I realize this increases efficiency (circulating air in the room) but I wish it was an optional feature. If you want A/C, even in standby, expect to have the fan blowing all the time.- No Canadian warranty. The instructions say the warranty is only for the continental 48 United States.PROS:- Wow, this thing cools fast. I've tried it in single host (2nd hose optional) and 2-hose configurations, and it works fantastic.- Compressor is pretty darn quiet. I've owned my share of A/C units and can tell you that this is a refined product. Good quality. Someone totally new to A/C might not realize this, but compared to other options. this unit has decent sound control.- 2 hose unit. It is more efficient to use 2 hoses (prevents less warm air being sucked into the home, and therefore better cooling) but it's not required. If you just want one hose going outside, this unit will still work just fine.",

In addition to being an air conditioner it is a fan, dehumidifier and heater. Offers temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. I have an odd window to attach the hoses to, but with some creative thinking the set up was fairly easy. It is bigger than I anticipated and louder than I expected. Overall I am very pleased with the product and would buy this brand again in the future.",

It is super cool, it has features across the top and the lighting is underneath the plastic and it's space age looking The installation was super quick it took me longer to get it out of the shipping box than it did to actually make it work in my garage room. I live in Texas and it's hot right now and this thing has this room cooled down in minutes. My price was great but it took about 8 days to get here. The unit is ideal. I formerly had an LG window unit, the smallest one they make and that was loud to me. Also in case I have a disaster this thing can easily be run by a portable generator so I could use it in case we have another hurricane. This is a buy if I ever had one.",

It is on rollers so you can easily move from one area to another. It has a continuous drain feature that allows it to drain the condensation outside from a low window or into a pan large enough to last through the night. It comes with a window vent device that is very easy to put in any standard window. We are very happy with our purchase and highly recommend this unit for it's quality and ease of use.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Needs Drained Every Hour in Cooling Mode",
    "reviewText": "There are a few glaring issues with this product1. The unit vibrates violently. If any tube/wheel/fan/vent is slightly out of place it will sound like a mid-sized motorcycle is revving inside your room. Every time I turn it on I have to press and lift various parts of the unit until I find out what is causing the noise before taping or angling it in a way that makes is quieter.2. The draining system is a massive design flaw. There are two separate compartments that hold water. The top compartment, which gathers water in the \"dehumidifier\" mode and the bottom department which gathers water in the \"cooling\" mode. Neither compartment is removable, so be prepared to lift the 100 lb unit to the bathtub to drain, or hold it 2 ft in the air above a bucket.3. The unit floods itself into turning off every hour in cooling mode. The user manual states that the unit should not collect water in cooling mode, but if if is an extremely humid environment it may turn off automatically and show a water warning. This happens every hour. I have triple checked that the fan is set up with the tubing at the suggested height, and it isn't extended more than 2 ft. I live in the notoriously dry state of Colorado, so humidity is not the problem. I have a similar standing AC unit in the next room over that has had no trouble dispelling the water up the tube for the past 3 months, but this one can not seem to last over an hour without turning off and needing drained.I purchased at around $270, which was 40% off at the time. Now I understand why it was marked so low. I recognized the brand name \"Honeywell\" and hoped for better, but was very disappointed.",

    "reviewText": "It seems like a better solution, right? You don't have to have a pointy 60-lb metal object hanging out your window. Easy to roll around etc.But it's not a better solution.1. In order to blow hot air out the window, the air has to come from somewhere. It's called negative pressure. This AC sucks air in from other rooms, from around your door frames etc. Warm air. So while it's cooling your room, it's also sucking warm air in from the rest of your house.2. The condenser condenses water. Unless you locate it near a drain, a unit like this has nowhere to send the water--so it just puts it back into the air. So you get a very MOIST environment. Like water is condensing on the unit and making little puddles.3. The compressor is noisy--and now it's inside your room rather than hanging out the window.4. It takes up valuable floor space.I suppose this unit is fine for what it is. But a good window unit will beat it 10 days out of 10.",

    "reviewText": "This air conditioner kept my large master bedroom cool the past year with no issues whatsoever. I loved how it has a variable speed compressor, which allows it to run quiet and efficient once a room gets to temperature, but on those days when you want to cool the place down quickly, you can let it rip and cool the room down quickly.I live in California, so humidity isn't an issue here and I've never had to deal with any leakage issues.The portability aspect wasn't important to me since it stayed in place the entire time, but it does have caster wheels if you wanted to roll it around from room to room. That said, the thing is HEAVY and the exhaust kit would need to be reinstalled in each window and that is the only downside of this unit. It feels like very cheap plastic and I could see it breaking easily. I used aluminum foil tape to hold the outlet duct into the window exhaust piece and then tape the plastic piece into the window frame itself. This kept it all attached together and I never had any issues with it breaking. Don't plug on moving this up and downstairs regularly or you're going to hurt yourself or the unit.I particularly liked the scheduling smart features and the bedtime mode. I like falling asleep in a chilly room but I don't want to wake up in a cold room. This allows for you to have precise control over the temperature while you're sleeping.My only other gripe with the unit is the unit makes a rather loud high pitched noise when turning on the compressor and thumps rather loudly. I got used to it, but I could imagine a sensitive sleeper would be woken up.",

    "reviewText": "I sleep hot regardless of the season. My options were to buy a huge fan and place it on me at all times during the night with a sheet as a blanket or just suffer through it. It took my bed being soaked with my sweat several summers in a row for me to give up and look into an air conditioner. I didn't want anything super amazing as the room I sleep in is fairly small. I did want a dual hose design since I've heard they're better at removing water from the system but it wasn't a deal breaker if I didn't get that.After much looking I came upon this unit. It has a remote, it works with Alexa, I can control the unit with my smartphone, it has the dual hose system but most importantly it's energy efficient. You see I used to have a hotel grade air conditioner and it ran most of the time due to the room it was in having no air flow. That unit was a champ as it kept that large room chilly all the time. Though it used a lot of power. It added over a hundred dollars to our power bill every month and I just couldn't deal with that again. Now this unit is much better but it only runs when I sleep and I clean the filter on the regular to keep it from using too much power. It hasn't broke my bank yet so that's always a plus. Oh, and did I mention this unit is a beast at cooling? I know I said the room is small but I'd never expect this unit to cool my bedroom in less than a couple of minutes like this unit does. Most of the time I forget to turn it on via my phone and it doesn't really matter. I enter my room, hit the on button and get into bed and within minutes I'm nice and chilly for a good nights sleep.I have very little to complain about with this air conditioner. It checks off a lot of boxes I had for what I wanted and then some. The only thing I can say is that it's a bit noisy. I don't see that as a bad thing cause most units are loud. Actually I don't know if I could sleep without the noise now. But if you have to have silence in order to drift off to dreamland then maybe find something else. The amount of features this unit has at a fairly decent price accompanied with it being energy efficient should be a top contender for most. Highly recommend.Whoops, almost forgot. My unit was missing the adapter that hooks to the plastic hose so to have water drawn away from the unit and into a better place. I contacted Midea for a replacement part and was told they don't carry certain parts and my only option was to send the entire unit back for a replacement. This was well after I had installed the unit. I, like the adult I am, called them stupid and argued their flawed logic. Sending a heavy piece of tech back because they forgot to add a small and almost weightless piece of plastic was asinine. Why put me and the poor delivery people through something so frustrating over something so simple. That conversation went on for too long and got me nowhere. In the end I didn't need the part but I highly suggest anyone buying this to check every part to make sure it's all there cause from what I can tell they don't carry parts that a normal company would.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Terrible and expensive….",
    "reviewText": "This review is for the Midea Duo. I bought this because I needed a portable AC for one of the bedrooms in my condo because the central air is inadequate. I especially wanted a smart AC so that I could use it with my Alexa ecosystem. Unfortunately, despite the good looks, quiet operation and good build quality, this thing has some major shortcomings that make it unusable and a complete waste of money.For starters, I received it with one of the tabs used to hold the hose in place on the window slider broken. Therefore, I needed a replacement part but Amazon doesn’t carry parts, so they had to send me a while new unit so that I could return the unit with the broken part. This delayed its use. Amazon was good about it so I don’t have any complaints there.The first major issue I have is with the window slider itself, a part that must be used in order to use the AC. For starters, you’d expect a $600 AC to come with high quality accessories but this part is cheaply made, flimsy and thin with absolutely no insulation properties at all. Furthermore, once assembled the sides are not flat, so you are left with gaps between the flat surfaces of the window and the sliders. They give you foam tape to adhere to the edges but this is inadequate. You’re left with a window insert that not only gets hot, but also lets bugs in and sound/ outside noise. The other issue with the slider is that for some stupid reason, they placed the hole for the exhaust hose very close to one edge. Its so close that when you use the sliding window adapter, it hits the sill and cannot snap into place. You have to build it out on that sure to get it to work. Why wouldn’t they just have centered it!? Furthermore, the hose is huge, probably twice the width of standard units and it’s unwieldy, so as gentle as I was being with this thing, one of the tabs broke (again!) and now it won’t connect properly … I had to glue it on with ABS cement so it doesn’t pull out. Unfortunately, due to the uncommon shape of the hose, you cannot upgrade to something else and you are left trying to modify it. Fine, I took two 1x2” wooden rails and created a box to support the sliders and added styrofoam to insulate it.Unfortunately, the second major problem is that this unit does nothing for the humidity while in AC mode because it reuses the condensation to make it more efficient… but, even though I have this thing keeping the room at 68 degrees, it jacked the humidity up to 84%! So the air is really dense and because of this it’s uncomfortable and useless! Unfortunately because of all the time it took to get this thing situated, Ive missed the return window by several days and now I’m out $600!I highly recommend staying away from this product. I really wanted to love it but instead I loathe it!Pros: good build quality of the AC unit itself, wifi and smart app enabled, quiet, blows a good amount of air.Cons: huge unwieldy exhaust hose, cheaply made and poorly designed hose adapter, cheaply made and poorly designed window sliders.",

    "reviewText": "This unit BLASTS cold air for a great distance. With the louvers set to “swing”—my whole living room gets cool very quickly. In fact—I had to turn it off a couple of times—and sit shivering under a blanket!I was also impressed at how quiet it is. I’ve only run it on the highest setting so far—and it’s right next to where I sit to watch TV. It doesn’t bother me at all.The remote control, and the WiFi connection to the app, were super easy to set up.The only problem (and it’s a BIG one) is the window installation kit. It only extends to 68.5 inches. My sliding glass door is 91 inches tall. Even using TWO complete sets of kits didn’t help. For one thing—all of the included panels don’t universally ‘mate’ to each other. As a result I had to use 2 panels with the opening for attaching the hose—and then mount another full panel behind the upper one, to cover the hole.The photo—taken after some of the upper panels came crashing down—shows how it buckles, and pulls the hose out of its panel, leaving enormous air gaps. Waiting for my favourite contractor to return from vacation to fix this mess!I ended up with a leaning tower of panels—with gaps you can put your fist through. Within a day—the various joints began to buckle—and the top 1/4 came crashing down.I think the window installation kit would work perfectly with the average hung or sliding window—making this unit an excellent choice.However, if you have to install in a sliding door—be prepared to construct a custom window kit, using wood.",

    "reviewText": "I have set up my airconditioner with the help of a friend. I was concerned that the item delivered was sent with the venting adapter for a hung window. That was a lot of plastic. And my window is a casement window. Fortunately a friend was able to use the adapter sent to me. Where I live, most apartments in any buildings built from the 1970s on tend to have casement rather than hung windows. It would be helpful to be able to opt out of receiving, and paying for, a vent adapter one can't use.I have given this a/c a test run. It is still too cool where I am to be using it for any length of time, so I can't give you an account of how satisfied I am with this purchase.",

I asked them a question on YouTube and the guy answered me in less than two hours with a legitimate answer. My main issue from the start is when you turn it on, the smell of burnt rubber is quite strong. I’m assuming after it’s been used for a bit that smell will get pushed out.It’s quite a lot of work putting it all together, I won’t lie and the shipping was absolutely horrible (FED EX) as I live on the fourth floor and I am disabled, and they brought it to the post office and left it there, I had nobody to help me bring it home, nobody with the car and this thing is 80+ kilograms so needless to say I destroyed myself and so did my wife helping me get it upstairs. She eventually had to do everything and to get a neighbour to go to his storage unit and bring a trolly cart in which still required all the lifting just with wheels to stop on each step to breathe",

    "reviewText": "I bought this for a studio so the area is much smaller than what it's designed for but I have no seperate rooms to seal up. Bought it with the intention of keeping it for a few years when I'll hopefully move to a bigger place.Unit has definitely been getting louder as time passes and I honestly feel like the filter isn't going to be enough to keep it maintained long term. Will definitely need to be opened up and cleaned out after a year or two.Works super well though and relatively easy to set up.Be careful with the ventilation hose/pipe. Easy to split the corners of it when extending to the window but I'm planning on insulating it anyway so not a deal breaker for me.App won't work with it on 5ghz wifi so make sure you have dual band or 2.5ghz if that's a dealbreaker for you. Personally I'll be buying a new router as my Shaw one doesn't work with most smart devices.Definitely recommend the AC unit.",

    "reviewText": "I live in Olympia, WA and bought this air conditioner for my bedroom 3 years ago. I have large bedroom with cathedral ceilings, so I worried a little about how many cubic feet it actually is, but this has worked perfectly for me, even on days when temps were close to 100 and the humidity is over 90%. I have personally found that just running the dehumidifier keeps me cool enough to be happy most of the time. I have also used the AC function and liked that as well, but eventually became too cold using it. I got this because the windows in the apartment where I live are the type that slide open sideways and don't open super wide, so I wasn't sure if a window unit would fit. I also like that I can easily take this out of the window and just keep the window open for a few days and then use it as needed by simply putting the hose/panel back in the window when I need it. I have used this for 3 summers now and even running it every day in a month for all or part of the day my electric bill has never gone up by more than around $10/month over what it normally is. I don't think it's the quietest machine out there, but after the first night, I get used to it and it just becomes white noise to me. I originally worried about draining it and kept checking all the time, but no water ever came out when I checked. I still check it about once a month since the humidity levels get over 90% here, but I still have not had any water come out any time I have checked. I also like this in the Spring because I have pretty bad allergies and this allows me to sleep without constantly coughing, sneezing, and wheezing for air. I have not noticed any reduction in efficiency over the last 3 years, nor any increase in noise. I would buy this again for the size room I have, but I would recommend a unit with more BTUs if you are using it in a larger area. I tried using this out in my living room/dining room which is all open to the kitchen too and although it helped, it did not cool down that much larger area.",

    "reviewText": "This has worked just fine since we got it in June to cool the bedroom at night. I don't find it that noisy but I can see where others might.It does a great job, in a bedroom which faces West, on a summer afternoon to evening it will take it from 81 to about 72 in three to four hours.The only caveat is if you live in very humid areas you will need to make a stand. Starting yesterday we have had temps in the nineties and much higher than normal humidity. For June and July I emptied the water about once a week. Yesterday it overflowed. I jerryrigged a stand for it from a moving dolly so it is about six inches off the floor. I took out the stopper and the threaded plug and force-fit in a six-inch length of 1/2\" I.D./3/4\" O.D. braided vinyl tubing. It is just a bit too tight so I made about a 3/8\" cut and pushed it into place. You have to remember to set the unit at a bit of an angle backwards so the water will drain into a catch pan below. So far this is working fine.If you live in humid areas you are going to need to set this up from the beginning. Construction blocks might be best, given the weight of the unit, since the wheels will fit in the holes and you could shim the blocks so there is a backward angle. If you go that route don't forget plastic on the floor so you don't scar the wood.",

    "reviewText": "This my third (in 10 years) portable air conditioner: Whynter (got 5 years life), Honeywell (on 4th year but sounds a bit like failure might be imminent). I have had very good experiences with other DeLonghi products so purchased this unit.My situation: 1100 square foot home kind of chopped up into small rooms but an open \"sunroom\" that is my home office - I work full time from the home office. I am in Northwest Montana and while not as arid as the southwest, humidity is typically in the mid-teens to mid-twenties, i.e. not much - actually perfect for comfort as far as I'm concerned. I like my house 65-68F year round. I have a northern breed dog who would probably like it 55F or less. Even my Norwegian Forest cat prefers cool. I have typically done well with 1 A/C unit and a couple of helper fans plus it usually cools into the 50's overnight so I can turn off everything midnight-1a.m. All of my windows are horizontal sliders.This unit - it arrived at 6:34 p.m. and by 7:12 p.m. it was running and that includes 10 minutes of huffing/puffing/swearing at the hose hookup which didn't want to stay hooked up. I eventually won. This is not better or worse than any other unit I've had - the darn connectors do not really \"screw\" on. A wee bit of strategically placed duct tape does wonders, though! The bedroom was 74 to start. Outside temperature was 93. It took an hour to cool down to 70 per a thermometer unit but I thought it felt quite comfortable in 30 minutes ... not THAT uncomfortable to start but cool moving air made a huge difference fast. I slept fine with the noise - fan on low but I'm used to the A/C-fan noise.re noise - this is definitely the quietest of any of the portables.Today, which is forecast to hit 96F and started at 61F, I moved the new unit to my living room which opens to my bedroom. Honeywell went to sunroom office. It is currently 85 outside and 65 inside. I have both units set to 65. The DeLonghi is keeping both living room and attached bedroom at 65 with no helper fan.Ultimately, even though short experience, I am so happy that I ordered a 2nd DeLonghi as we are to be in 90's for the foreseeable future. I think these are reasonably priced units and if I get 4-5 years ($100 or less per year) out of them, I am happy.***wishlist slightly longer hose, slightly longer power cord, better way to connect hose",

    "reviewTitle": "Very good portable A/C that can be adapted to casement windows, with a little extra work.",
    "reviewText": "I purchased this portable A/C because I have casement windows and for the promise of a quieter functioning machine. Fortunately, I was able to easily set up the exhaust bracket in my window and the Pinguino's compressor noise is tolerable, so I am very pleased with it! After 2 weeks, it is working well, easily handling the sauna-like humidity of a stinking Montreal summer; now I can breathe easier and sleep well at night. My bedroom is 160 sq ft, but I got the 12000 btu unit (instead of the standardly recommended 6000 btu) because my environmental conditions include full sun for most of the day, intolerable humidity, with electronics in the room. This A/C's capacity is probably too large for my space, but from all the reviews I read, and all the lower powered ones selling for secondhand in Montreal, it seems that the btu charts online do not apply to portables - so I added at least 3000 btu to the recommended capacity to increase my satisfaction with my purchase. In the end, I opted for this unit because it was not offered in a 10000 btu model. After reading other reviewers' experiences (on both of Amazon's websites), I put a little pan under the water drain, but found no need to wrap the exhaust hose in Reflectix.Pros: Lots! Lowest cooling temp is 18 degrees Celcius, many different functions so that you can customize your comfort level (I tried them all!), tolerable noise levels, thick plastic housing, very easy to use display and remote control, sweet Italian quality and design.Cons: Only one - the recommended set up for casement windows in the manual is ridiculous, but the basic structure of this type of window means that extra work is necessary in order to install a portable air con. My advice is to try to fit the exhaust bracket horizontally in the frame and top it off with coroplast board (like me) or cut the coroplast to full size and secure the exhaust adapter to it, with a hole cut for the exhaust (like my bro). Thanks to some good online videos with detailed instructions, I was able to do it!All in all, I am very happy with my purchase, and have revised my low opinion of portable air conditioners in general. Although it was scary to buy a portable A/C online, without being able to experience a functioning machine firsthand, I was able to choose this one thanks to all the reviewers who came before me! Merci beaucoup!",

    "reviewText": "During the deadly, climate-change induced heatwave on the western coast here last summer, I bit the bullet and bought a second air conditioner unit for our small rental unit. (The other air conditioner is an LG of a similar size.) Together, both air conditioners made life inside not only bearable, but comfortable! The De'Longhi distinguishes itself nicely by being quieter than the other one.My only complaint about this air conditioner is that the sliding piece that goes in the window is much too short! Seriously, people: this is cheap plastic: no need to be so stingy with it! I ended out buying a foam insulator and just layering it horizontally back and forth to get the installation to the length of my window. Despite that initial difficulty, I was extremely glad to have the unit! But there's no question that this is an annoying and completely unnecessary design flaw.",

    "reviewTitle": "So far, a great portable A/C unit",
    "reviewText": "Okay...this is the first portable A/C unit I've owned. I held off purchasing one for quite a while as I couldn't figure out how to set one up with the window that I have (tall, swings out at bottom). But after finding a window seal that is set up for windows that swing out at the side, and adapting that, I was able to set up this A/C unit. I placed it in my bedroom (approx. 11x12) and have to say that the difference in temperature was almost immediate as soon as I turned it on. I live in a city that can get very hot and humid in the summertime (Ottawa, Canada...high temps can be upward of 40deg Celsius), and I have a dog who doesn't tolerate heat very well, so - after a failed attempt with a swamp cooler (does not work in high humidity areas) - decided to put my money on the De'longhi. And so far, no regrets.I love the remote that comes with this unit. I love that the air conditioner takes almost no time to cool down an 11x12 room. I love that it isn't that much of a space hog (a bit, but to be expected with portables). And I love that it has a noise dampening option. Personally, my hearing sucks. I wear hearing aids, and when I take them out at night to sleep, a bomb wouldn't wake me, so noise isn't an issue there. But in the evenings where I decide to run the A/C in my living room (vertical slider in that room, the window kit that comes with the A/C works perfectly in the window) the A/C needs to be quieter so I can hear the tv. On 'whisper' mode, it's perfect. Yes, the A/C still makes some noise, but not enough to interfere. I also love the fact that it doesn't require emptying of a water reservoir. Well, so far none....but even if it did need to be done once or twice during a summer season, thatThe only con that I have so far with this unit is that, while it is portable, it is very heavy and makes it rather difficult to move from room to room, esp. if thick carpeting is involved. However, this is such a minor annoyance that it's hardly worth mentioning.Time will tell if this A/C stands up to long-term use...so far I've used it 7 or 8 times - but for now, I'm really pleased, and really glad that I bought it.*Update: Within the first few months of using this A/C unit I noticed that it was very wobbly whenever I had to move it from one room to another, and it started to get lopsided. It took me a while to figure out, but finally did...one of the wheels was damaged and completely missing after moving it. To me this is a 'this shouldn't happen with ordinary use'; however, I have had the A/C for two years now, and despite this one 'shouldn't have happened' defect, the A/C itself is still working fine. (My workaround, I put a book under the defective side.)It's very rare that I need to actually remove water from it, and I live in a very high-humidity area (Ottawa, Canada). Compare this to a Costway A/C that I purchased earlier this year (so I would no longer need to move the A/C from room to room): the Costway unit was used 3 times, and on the third morning I woke up to the carpet in my bedroom absolutely, completely soaked with water (and my hardwood floors underneath probably damaged).I still back up the De'Longhi A/C in terms of functionality, and would recommend it.",

    "reviewText": "Had mine for about a month. It is rated at 400 sq ft but my main floor is mostly open concept and over 700 sq ft. It's a new house and well insulated but I was concerned the unit might be too small. It worked well and kept the house cool during what we consider an extreme heat wave (32C) in BC Canada.The hose panel worked well in my side sliding window but I'd suggest also using a window screen on that window to insure no bugs can get in. The foam provided with the kit will probably work when you first install it. After a while the vibration and air flow will probably wiggle a hole big enough for bugs. The hot exhaust air did not do any visible damage to my (glass fibre / plastic) screen.The only problem was available stock. I think I got the last two units (one for me and one for my kid's house) in the end of July. I plan to buy more units to cool the upper story when they show up again (October?). Looks like global warming means folks in BC Canada now need A/C in the future.",

I took it out yesterday June 26 ,2023 for the first time this year and the unit is not cooling ! I did all that was recommended as per the manual( trouble shooting ) and it still did not provide any cool air . A diagnostic revealed that there was a gas leak and it is not repairable . The type of gas is R-410A and is now illegal to use as it is extremely flammable . I contacted Delonghi and was told that the 2 year warranty had expired 2 months ago and there was nothing they could do ! Pretty poor service and how are you suppose to know if the unit was not working in April when there is still snow on the ground . If You add up all the hours that this unit was used it is not a very good investment !",

I went a couple days without it and it was so HOT in my area. I used a regular fan and would sit in it and would take my pants off, it was sooo hot. I thought about it and googled Briza and looked around… I was dying of heat exhaustion, so I bought it… one time payment without paying monthly for A/C?! You just put water in it! ♥️ That’s it!!! I thought and went for it… IT IS THE BEST PRODUCT!!! Cools off with and without the “cool” on. It saved my life to not overtoast! I say get it honestly you won’t regret it.",

By the time that arrives, it’ll probably be too late to send this over priced piece of junk back, if that was ever even an option anyway.",

Ice would be useful too but the fill port is very small and will not fit standard sized ice cubes. I refrigerate a gallon of water and then use that to fill the unit. Even when not filling with water and just using the fan feature, this effectively blows air and does a decent job of cooling the room.I have been looking for an air cooler for some time and most are super cheap and un-trustworthy. This one works well, but it does come at a price.",

    "reviewText": "My fiance and I moved from a city that has central AC everywhere to a city where AC apparently only exists in buildings built within the last decade and we have a hard time handling their summers (even though its actually cooler here). Maybe it's because we've only tried cheaper ($20-40) fans in the past but this has been a god send. It's really easy to use and it really seems to cool down an entire room whether or not we put water in the container but the water definitely cools it down even more. The only reason they lose a star is because it's such a hassle to put water in it. Instead we've decided to just remove all the screws on the bottom and we just remove the top part completely to fill the tank.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars It's not a refrigerated air conditioner, it's an evaporative cooler, meaning you need low humidity.",
    "reviewText": "The star rating is relative to value for the money. There are better units out there, but they cost 3-4 times as much. Next, if your climate is such that you are over 30% relative humidity, which is just about everything east of the Rockies, this won't work for you. It works best in the Desert Southwest unless it's Monsoon Season. The humidity will be well over 30% It is meant for small spaces, not whole houses. It does a good job on a 400 sq ft or less room. I had this along on a recent RV fishing trip and we dry camped for a while. My generator is light duty and not enough power for the trailer air conditioner, so I ran this off a combination of an inverter then generator when my battery level came down and even though it was 95+ degrees (with 8% relative humidity), the trailer (26 ft box) kept below 80 degrees. Today the high temp in the California High Desert is going to be about 103 (about 10% relative humidity) , I am using it with the oscillation feature to keep cool air blowing on me while I am working on my truck making the process bearable in my hot garage.As for the leaking that others complained about, I have only had the issue if I had it off-level as I did on the fishing trip I mentioned. If you take the screw out of the screen, lift it up, you will see how the water flows down the pad. If the unit is leaning slightly back, it's possible the water can transfer from the pad to the plastic case and then leak out. You may think your floor is level, but I can put a level to a lot of floors and it will show off level. Solution is to just put something under the rear wheels to elevate the rear of the unit a little, then gravity will do the rest.If you have been using hard water, the holes may plug up in the trough at the top of the pad, so you'll need to clean those holes periodically.Replacement pads you can get at your local hardware / home improvement store, you'll have to cut them to size. If the water pump fails, it's just a simple fountain pump you can buy at the same place. I use a surge protector because it does have electronics and a power surge from the grid can blow it out.Lastly, you can't use it in a closed up house or room. You have to have two windows open at least on opposite sides of the room for some air flow. If you don't, then all you will do is build up humidity in the room, and it will quit being effective. If the wind isn't blowing to provide a natural air flow, then I will use one of those window fans pointed out in a window in another part of the house.In short, it more than meets my expectations for a unit of this price. If you have larger expectations, then you should go to your local Home Depot and shop their units that cost $500 or more and blow much more air.That's my opinion, I hope it helps. Cheers!!!!",

    "reviewText": "THE GOOD: The front grid is more solid than the previous model. If you fill it with Ice and Water, it does help to cool....but only if you add ice. If you just fill with water it is no better than a fan. It is a nice looking unit. THE BAD: The power cord is much shorter than the previous model, which is a problem. The remote is flimsy, cheap, doesn't work that well and is really difficult to open. Once you do open it, you will find it needs one of those round, Quarter size batteries (which, of course, is not included). This model doesn't beep when the water level is getting low. There is no warning system. You have to unscrew the back of the unit in order to clean the filter. With the previous model you could just slide the filter out to clean it.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Just like any product there will be people that don't use them correctly or complain about anything and once in awhile they do get a defective product. The unit I bought is for 400 Sq ft and use it for a 375 Sq ft area. It makes it cold quick. I live in a low humidity area where most days we have the windows open with box fans however on the days it reaches 80's and 90's we turn on our wall unit AC in the living room which doesn't cover the whole home. This honeywell AC easily covers the rest of the area. The design is nice, the size isn't overwhelming, it rolls around easily, and it is very quick to set up or take down out of the window. When the fan is on high yes you can hear it but not to the point of having to talk over it. Way quieter than a typical window AC unit.You will need to get some weather stripping which is very inexpensive. The piece that goes in the window is meant to fit not seal. I also read a one star review about it being 8.6 amps and it has to he plugged in to a single plug outlet. Most US homes have plugs rated at 15-20 amps. This simply means you can plug in the AC to any regular outlet just don't plug anything else in to the outlet at the same time. The unit also has a breaker switch on the plug.If you buy it immediately register the warranty and you're good to go. 10/10 would recommend.",

It runs really efficiently, and reaches set temperature quickly. I have not needed to use the dehumification mode yet, so can't comment on the installation of the drainage for that type of setup. I would have given it 5 stars; but the exhaust vent tube on the back side is quite large, and you need quite a bit of space behind the unit, and in a camper that could be a little lacking. However, if you placed this in a cabin or small room of home, it would be fine. I would highly recommend this AC Unit.",

I would recommend getting sturdier window brackets, especially if you have a vertical sliding windows. The ones that come with the unit are flimsy. Otherwise, it’s a nice compact size and cools my large living room well. It has an auto shut off when it reaches the desired temp. It is a tad loud but worth it to be cooler.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars You won't win with this one! Would give it ø stars if I could!",
    "reviewText": "This portable AC could easily be the poster child for the \"portable air conditioners are highly/the most inefficient air conditioning option\" OR \"portable air conditioners are the air conditioners of last resort\" statement(s).So, this AC was meant for a room under 200 sq. ft., but, because it has some computer equipment in it which generates SOME heat (we're talking high end laptop, not server room), I got this unit for a space almost 4x the square footage of the room. So here are my observations:• Window installation kit should include foam & weather stripping because there are a LOT of gaps left when provided equipment is installed. They don't address these at all! I mean, at least note the need for this before the poor sap (customer) begins the installation process.• Plastic panels.... Well, one side is nice, solid, thick, plastic, & leaves narrow gaps.... The other side is thin, flimsy plastic that not only heats up just from the outside heat, but also leaves a total of 1/2\" worth of gaps... As I noted before, the install kit includes not a darn thing to address this with. The panels warm up (as plastic will) from the ambient air outdoors (especially when installed in a sunny window) AND one side also warms up from the exhaust (making it a double whammy). Before you start installing anything, do yourself the favor of taking measurements and purchasing foam insulation -- best in sheet form so you can cut to sizes you need! AND you will need weather stripping to apply above and below the edges of the plastic panels to best deal with the gaps. The plastic, in fact, heats up so much from the outside, that it actually requires the use of thermal heat shielding on the outward facing surface AND insulation on the interior facing surface. They don't tell you that so you can have everything at the ready before you start the install project --- which is far more involved that the simple set of instructions would lead you to believe.• Note that installation will leave you with a security risk with most types of windows because there is no provision made for dealing with the fact that your window will no longer stay properly closed (much less lock).• This thing generates heat! In initial hours of operation, as is recommended for most ACs & dehumidifiers, it's best to run them on the highest fan & lowest temp. settings. Which is where I started.... Well, the back of the unit heated up like crazy -- almost too hot to keep a hand on. I stuck with it, though, since the room was already warm anyway.... After about 5hrs. of continuous operation it settled into a pattern and ran cooler --- lukewarm or so. But, it still generates heat, which compounds the warmth in the room especially with prolonged use, which means the unit has to fight itself as well as the room conditions. The very definition of inefficient!• The exhaust tube reaches surface temps. in excess of 120˙F. A Cool-Aide insulation kit is a MUST! With the kit installed, the exhaust hose surface temp. stays a bit above the room temp. Without it, there is no way this unit could cool a shoe box! Even with it, the areas where the exhaust hose connects to the unit & where it connects to the window panels are a point of heat getting released into the room you're trying to cool. Again, the very definition of inefficient! In fact, insulating the tube with a thermal/heat barrier & THEN sliding it into the Cool-Aide sleeve is your best option -- cuts the tube's radiant heat to near 0. But, no matter what you do, the exhaust tube's connection points cannot be insulated. Nowhere in the manuals or product descriptions will you see that addressed either! These machines should ALL come with insulating sleeves -- they simply will not cool a room they are sitting in without it & yet none of them come with this critical equipment.• Because of the heat the unit generates along the surfaces near & around the exhaust port (which cannot be insulated in any way), the room temp. NEVER got below 74˙F. In a small room, the unit loses the battle against the heat it generates & it simply doesn't have enough cooling power for even the room size it is rated for. Keep in mind, it wasn't able to get a ~200 sq. foot room below 74 degrees... And even that achievement came only when the unit's fan was at its lowest setting.... So what hope is there of cooling a 400 sq. ft. space?• Noise..... Much noisier than you expect upon reading the decibel ratings. Especially in small rooms. You can't hear yourself think with the fan set to \"high\". And it's not likely to win the battle between the heat in the room & the heat it itself generates on low.... Maybe on medium. When all that is taken into account, the unit is noisy.• Weight..... Be prepared for 10+lbs of added weight from the packing material alone. And, while it IS one of the lightest such units on the market, it's an unwieldy weight. There aren't actual handles for moving the unit as much as grooves in the design you can kind of get your fingertips into if you have \"smallish\" hands. I'll tell you this much, it was a pain getting it up a flight of stairs! Not because of the weight alone, but because it was hard to get a hold of the thing. I have a dehumidifier that weighs about the same as this unit that is FAR easier to move because it has handholds along the top of two sides. Without handholds, this unit is much more difficult to move than you'd expect.• Cold humidity.... That's what you get.... It started off with a room at 86˙F (thank you heat wave) at 40% humidity. It managed to get the room to 74˙F (though set to 67) at 60% humidity.... Which makes no sense for something with a built in dehumidifier & is self-evaporative too! The humidity level should have at the very least remained at 40%. So, what I am dealing with now is a cool, clammy, humid feeling room. Better than hot, humid, clammy -- which is insufferable to me & affects my health -- but definitely will not do in the long run.• Unsightly when set up as needed.... With the addition of the necessary insulation sleeve, this unit doesn't look anywhere near as neat and tidy as the product pictures would lead you to believe.• Takes up virtually as much space as a window unit with the same effect. Aside from the new U shaped window & new saddle window units on the market, these portable units' exhaust setup will take up almost as much space as a window unit for the same-sized room with the added security risk that is much more difficult to address than for a true window unit.... The plastic is too flimsy on this portable unit's exhaust setup to allow for sufficient pressure application to make the window truly secure. A true window unit is much sturdier & allows for windows to be secured in place without worry of breaking brittle plastic panels.• Moving it room to room will not be as easy as it sounds either. You have to go through the while rigamarole of dealing with the gaps with the exhaust panels every time. Not to mention finding a solution for securing the windows each time you move the unit.Any pros., you ask? Well.... It's easy enough to assemble -- consists of just attaching the hose. The controls are big, easy to read, and intuitive -- don't really need a manual to operate it. The castor wheels' design allows for easy movement of the unit even on carpet.My advise...... Window units are indeed better. More of a pain with removal for the season, but definitely not more of an effort to install (when figuring in all the material deficiencies with this unit) and they don't add any of their operating heat back into the environment they are cooling. Second to those are in-wall or through-the-wall units. Third are units that sit outside in the elements (they can be as problematic, though in different & more costly ways, as portable units in my experience). I've now had all three types & can whole heartedly agree with professional assessments of them & rank them the same way. I have a through-the-wall unit that is now 15+ years old (and about to be replaced) that, in all those years, hasn't given me even half the issues I've had with this portable unit did in just ONE day of use. No way this unit would give you that many years of consistent, trouble-free cooling as its window & through-the-wall counterparts -- probably marginally less headaches & expense than external options.I will be sending this thing back from whence it came.... And replacing it within a few days with a window unit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advertising for window ACs.... I'd MUCH rather work with easily removable exhaust tubes and stuff, but these portable units are indeed incredibly inefficient. One tube, twin tube, the same issues which need to be addressed the same way. They are simply not worth the money, nor the hassle. And they are no more portable, in general, than fixed units simply because of their weight.In conclusion.... Count the true costs before purchasing any portable AC. Stay away from this one in general....If you took the time to read all this, God bless =) And I hope you found it worthwhile in the end.",

    "reviewText": "Helped keep my infant daughter's room a safe temperature during a heatwave while we searched for better housing that had central air. Well worth the price. I do recommend aiming the vents to the highest possible angle, as cold air sinks to the bottom of the room while hot air rises. Therefore, if you put the unit on the floor as is typical for this style of AC, aiming the vents down will cause a pretty significant temperature gradient where your feet will feel pretty cool, but your upper body will feel hotter. Aiming upward helps stir the air in the room a bit better and negates this effect, but this isn't really the unit's fault--it's just a fact of life for floor-mounted portable AC units.Our power bill didn't shift much, if at all, while running this machine. Would recommend.",

    "reviewText": "Attention!!! Needs to be cleaned at least once per month! I use this everyday for at least 5 hours. When you start to get a funny smell I drain, add distilled white vinegar and wash the media once per month. I do this in the bathtub and it is easy to clean. Just allow time for parts to fully dry. I put the media (filter) outside in the sun to \"deodorize\" to avoid odor. I use dish soap to clean filters. When you do this it avoids a \"smell\". This was waiting for me when I got home and I must say that this is one of the smartest purchases I've ever done! It works great and keeps my room cool! I followed the directions and added ice and this blows air (with ice) at 64 degrees! Without the ice it still blew around 70 degrees! My AC unit did not turn on the entire time I had this running. Definitely a money saver on my electric bill! I had the ceiling fans running and place this in my living room allowing the air to be evenly distributed throughout my home. Also, the fan is VERY strong! In other words, I run it only on low. The fan really puts out a TON of air! I tried medium and high for fun and it really moves the air. The sleep mode seems to run the fan on medium which is a little strong for me. It is not near as noisy as I anticipated and you get used to the sound very quickly. It isn't so much as a fan humming sound as it is hearing the airflow move. The pictures I included are the unit running solely on room temperature distilled water with no ice. I believe the pictures speak for themselves on how well this unit works. It is a little water \"hungry\" but I did buy the 53 pint unit. It takes almost 6 gallons of water to fill but the water doesn't need changing for at least a week depending on where you use it. It has a water level gauge on the front to let you see minimum and maximum levels. I only put in three gallons of water. I love how the level meter is \"float\" controlled by the water in the tank. This gives a more accurate reading since adding ice will add to the water level. I recommend no more than 5 gallons if using ice. It has water that runs over the ice to help melt it and it REALLY cools the air down very quickly. Again, buy this and you'll never regret it!!!! Very happy customer and I am buying 2 more!",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars It's Junk. Don't buy Honeywell. So far NOT OK. (updated)",
    "reviewText": "Update Year 3. My girlfriend asked on a hot day, why aren't you using the swamp cooler. So I cleaned it off and filled it up. Oh yeah the pump doesn't work. It probably stopped working the first year which is why I didn't use it since then. At first I was pleased that it had stopped dumping water out of the back, but this was only because the pump was failing.So I ordered a replacement pump. No refunds on the pump. Honeywell must know what junk this thing is. I took off the back and thought well, I'll also fix the depth indicator (this had never been installed. Impossible to get to. I want to just throw the whole thing out (and never buy another Honeywell anything ever again). But I can't cancel the pump I ordered yesterday that won't arrive for for another 10 days. (They claim it was already shipped. I ordered it 6 pm Saturday, it's 3:30 pm Sunday)Update: 1 Year. It leaks out of the soaker frame in the back-all over the floor. Can only be used outside. No reason this suddenly started happening. It's not an easy fix. The low fill door and missing water level gauge has been a huge annoyance. It would have been so easy to put a large funnel on the top for filling. There are inexplicable button combinations that disable speed. Default On is fan, not cooling. Bottomline? This unit just seems badly designed in many wrong ways. Update: One month. Cleaning. There doesn't seem to be anyway, other than through the fill door to get my hand, and a sponge to the bottom of the tank. There seems to be no instructions for cleaning it out. TIP: before buying any evaporative cooler Google how to clean it first. Honeywell only seems to have marketing happy talk. General instructions for this type of cooler are not useful because there's no way to get inside this model. I've only run reverse osmosis water, and ran maybe 12 gallons through in the past month, last weekend after I filled it up I noticed gunk floating around in the water. So it needs cleaning out on a regular basis. Not a big deal-- if you can gain access.Old review: I just received this and got it working. What I immediately noticed: Instead of one useless user manual, there are two. There's also a Honeywell video, don't bother: You already know what a swamp cooler does. You can read the buttons on the top of the machine. That's all the video covers. A complete waste of time.What is the capacity of this? I think it's about 6 gallons, but I couldn't find anything in the manuals or the website that cover this.The water level window seems pretty useless (that's because the indicator needle is sitting loose on the bottom of the tank. ) I put in at least three gallons and it doesn't even register at the Minimum.It takes a lot of water, but the water intake door is just OK at best. They could've easily designed a huge funnel as the side panel to raise the point you add water, and so you could add water as fast as you can pour. ) It cools by adding water to the air, that water evaporates which requires heat, so the air cools. If you use this in a closed room, the humidity will rise to the saturation point and no more cooling will occur. I'm using this in Los Angeles where humidity levels are 45% to 60%, though the first day I used this the report was 84%. It's worked pretty good across this range. The output fan is strong, the output temperature is about 10 degrees F below the temperature of the intake air. It sits next to an open door, so it's not recirculating room air. This should give you an idea of how well this will work.It sits near where I work on my computer, at low the air flow is pretty high, so if you need a swamp cooler for just one person in one basic position, then this unit is probably too large 500 CFM, half would probably do it.I remain annoyed about the fill method and it arriving with a broken fill level indicator. (Using the levered needle is pretty stupid design. The fill level window is very low on the unit. There's a float right next to this stupid fill level window. So why even use a float and a lever if the level window is so low on the unit???? With a float or levered indicator needle it would be dead simple to show the level right at the top of the unit where it could be easily read. Also the ice compartment at the top. It would not be at all difficult to add a little flap and make this the fill point-it's huge compared to the stupid little flap on the side. Anyone at Honeywell paying attention????)",

    "reviewText": "This actually works very well. I've had it for maybe a couple weeks now and so far it seems to be doing a good job. However, you really need to understand how to operate it properly to get the best results. Here are some notes to take into consideration:1. It works best in the low humidity, but it's going to gradually increase the humidity in the room as it runs.2. It's not going to cool the room like an air conditioner would, but if you have ice around it will cool similar to an a/c while it's using the ice. It actually gets to the point where you need to shut it down from getting the room too cool, but not when it's running only on water.3. The water basin holds a lot of water. I've been using a 6 gallon plastic water bottle and a battery operated water pump. It makes it super easy to fill. If not, you'll need to have maybe a 2 gallon container to fill it.4. One of the things I don't like is that you can get a slight odor in the air. I don't believe this is from the actual unit, but from the water when it adds humidity to the air. I'm going to try one of those aromatherapy diffusers, but it doesn't arrive until today. Hopefully this will help keep the air smelling fresh.5. The unit will work with or without the window open. I do both because you get the fresh air from outside circulating. However, it will add humidity to the air faster with the window closed, which can sometimes make the room more comfortable if it's typically dry.All-in-all, it works great. There's just a learning curve to understanding what it will and won't do, plus how to set it up. Would recommend for sure. :-)",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very powerful unit but not for home use",
    "reviewText": "My office is upstairs facing West with approximately 1500 watts of equipment heat that needs cooling. On triple digit days, like we've been having here for the past couple weeks, my office will never get below 85-90 with the central AC alone. So I must have supplemental cooling. I've been using an LG 12000 BTU (LP1200dxr) unit since 2010, and it's a wonderful unit, and can cool my office down to a crisp 60 deg, even during triple digit weather. But we needed it for another upstairs room, where the kids sleep, since the LG is very quiet it made sense to move it to that room. So I went shopping for a new unit for my office. :)I almost purchased another consumer unit, but I ended up with the Tripp Lite SRCOOL12K for a couple reasons.1. The cool air duct for spot cooling2. I plan to use it in either a dedicated equipment room or garage in next house, and this unit seemed more suited for those environments.Initial Thoughts...The Good- Unit looks good and blends in well with modern office equipment- I like the orientation of unit and placement of the cool air vent and exhaust hose.- Dual air filters are great. My old LG unit only had a single air filter, and the inner radiator would always need a lot of cleaning at the end of the season. I have a feeling this Tripp Lite unit will be lower maintenance.- VERY powerful cooling. My LG unit was also 12000 BTU, but this Tripp Lite feels much more powerful. It seemed to cool down my office in half the time, and the spot cooling has enough air flow that it could double as a weed blower.The Bad- Lack of remote control is a bummer. Especially given the way the fan works see below)- The unit is VERY loud! After an hour I have a headache from the noise this thing makes from about 6 ft away. This is not something you will want to use in a space where people are working, and definitely not where people are sleeping. Of course, it isn't marketed for that either.- The Fan never turns off. Given the performance of the unit, I could probably live with the noise, while its cooling, but the fan never stops, ever... Even in quiet mode, the unit is unbearably loud. If the fan would cycle off, or at least have a slow, whisper mode then it would be acceptable. But even on the lowest fan setting you will go deaf having this thing in the same room with you. This is where a remote would have at least been handy to turn the unit off to help control noise.Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great unit. It does exactly what it was meant to do, and is everything that it's advertised to be. I can see putting this unit in a server room, or garage, or similar location that would ruin a less capable (albeit quieter) consumer unit. And I will probably keep it for that, as that's the long term plan anyway. This is a powerful portable air conditioner that cools great. I just wouldn't recommend it for home use, or for spaces close to people working in a quiet environment.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars OK but if I had it to do over I'd keep looking",
    "reviewText": "I purchased this in May 2016 to cool a small 14 x 6 server room that has two ThinkServers and a few switches -enough heat buildup to be a issue but not enough to expect cooling to be a major problem.The first unit died in about 3 months, and Tripp Lite support was kind enough to ship a replacement unit. This cost me $50 in shipping & a week without cooling but I did learn some things which may help you.First, while speaking to tech support, I found out that this unit is only designed to run 4-6 hours per day. That could be a problem when it's 100 degrees outside, the office A/C is off for the weekend, your servers are spewing heat, and the temp is set to 65 on the SRCOOL12k. Lesson: The office A/C is still going to have to take on the majority of the cooling work.Second lesson. I had the first unit set to \"high\" and the thermostat set about 4 degrees cooler than the office A/C. I assumed it would cool down & then run intermittently after that. I was wrong. It ran constantly. I believe the issue is that it exhausts so much air from the room that it is constantly sucking in warmer air from the office & can never get ahead of itself. I now have the fan set to low & it seems to be doing a much better job.Third lesson. If you live in an area where humidity is a problem, run the hose. We bought into the marketing that this would evaporate the humidity in the exhaust. It overflowed on the weekend & made a mess. After that we ran a drain hose & it's worked well since.Fourth lesson. The SNMP module for this thing made it a lot more complicated than it was worth. Even after you get past the fact that you need an old in-secure version of java to run it, it seems to get confused. Simple is better. I removed the SNMP kit & am just letting it run with the front panel controls. I'll find another gizmo to monitor the temp & alert.Last recommendation: based on the first one dying after 3 months, buy the extended warranty.I considered numerous residential/commercial air conditioning units but went with this one because it seemed to be designed for the IT environment. I therefore assumed that it would offer better reliability & better controls than the other A/C units, especially with the SNMP module. I was wrong. I have other Tripp Lite equipment that works well but this is tarnishing the brand. I believe I would have been as well off or better off with one of the $400 units from the big box home improvement store.Summary: When it works it works acceptably well. Documentation is average at best. Some best practices/scenarios would really have helped. Support was good. If you are cooling racks there is likely value in the tubing that they provide to duct air into the rack. If you are just cooling a room like me you can likely get more cooling for your buck with a standard air conditioner.*** Update ***The replacement unit died in September 2017. No one fixes them, the factory warranty was over so I filed a claim on the extended warranty. Kudos to Square Trade, they don't fix them either but they did issue a check for the purchase price. I bought another room air conditioner at the local home improvement store for a couple hundred dollars less than this unit. Frankly the new one is doing a better job of cooling. We'll see if it lasts longer.",

    "reviewText": "This air conditioner contains everything you need to cool a server closet. Before installing this unit the room that houses our IT gear would routinely reach 88 degrees, clearly not good for your equipment. After installing this unit the server room stays at a cool 67 degrees. Our server closet is about 200 square feet with one telco rack worth of equipment in it. It comes with all the necessary parts to vent the warm air and condensation to a dropped ceiling. Our dropped ceiling is about 12 feet above the floor, and there was still a few feet of pipe left.Do not install this unit without venting the hot air, your server room will overheat quickly! Once the exhaust vent is properly setup all you have to do is plug the unit in, turn on the power, set the temperature and wait a few minutes to watch the temperature drop. The other portable air conditioners I was looking at were not designed to vent to a dropped ceiling, this one is and it was exactly what I needed.Full disclosure, I have only been using this product for a few days.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Purchase... But Loud!",
    "reviewText": "Before I get started, I'd like to say that I'm the type of guy who absolutely can NOT stand the heat. Anything over 80 degrees and I start losing my marbles. I get easily irritated, I get a bad temper, can't focus, can't work, and can't think straight when it gets too hot at home. So when the recent heat waves were hitting California, I knew I had to buy a portable AC. I ended up purchasing this particular unit because it was slightly cheaper than the competition, and more importantly it had a dual hose setup which I wanted. Won't lie, I had my reservations making this purchase, since so many things can go wrong with this type of product. However, when it arrived and I started using it, it's been nothing but an icy blast thus far!So here we go with the details. The unit arrived, and I set it up myself without any issues. Took me about 30 min to get it all done. I noticed that the window board was pretty thin, so I put some extra foam behind the edges of the board to block some outside noise (kids playing in the courtyard). Additionally, I also put gorilla tape around the whole edge of the window board to prevent hot air from leaking into the apartment.After getting it set up, I let it rest for 24 hours (which you should always do with portable AC's). I came home the next day from work and it was about 95 degrees outside. However, inside my apartment felt way hotter like a sauna/green room as it was baking in the heat with the windows closed all day. Immediately, I put this baby on blast at the highest setting, and set the temperature to 61 degrees which is the lowest. A short 10 minutes later, the apartment living room felt like it was livable again. An hour later, and I was in a cool paradise. I even set up a box fan that blew from my living room into my bedroom and to my surprise, this method actually cooled my room down to a sleepable temperature!The first two weeks I've had it I was super paranoid with the whole leakage situation. I would check back every 1-2 hours like clockwork to see if the AC was leaking water onto the floor. Part of my paranoia was caused by the dripping sound I hear within the unit. To my surprise, even after a month of use, I haven't gotten any leakages! The self evaporating system seems to be working great thus far, at least in my humidity level. If you want to compare to your environment, just look up Culver City, California temperatures & humidity and you'll be able to see what kind of environment my AC has been running on. Today is 86 degrees, with 53% humidity, and I usually have it running 6-10 hours a day. No leaks, and no drain pipe needed, at least not yet.There was one small issue I've had though. This is NOT a quiet unit. If you're looking for something quiet perhaps for a baby's room, this is not the one. It definitely runs loud. I don't know the exact decibel level but when sitting next to it, it sounds like there's a tiny lawn mower roaring next to me. I'm completely OK with the sound level, and it's not loud enough to interfere with my discord calls, even when I'm sitting right next to it, so all is well. Plus, I'd rather my apartment be a little noisier but cool, than silent and hot lol...All in all, this was a magnificent purchase thus far and worth every dollar. It seems like each individual customer's experience may vary, but mine has been great through this month of intense Cali heat. Would strongly recommend this product to anyone who feels like their soul is melting to the heat. Hope this helps!TLDR: Reliable unit so far, great cooling, easy assembly, no leaks, but LOUD!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars SUPER cold and powerful unit. Dual hose beats my single hose unit hands down.",
    "reviewText": "I purchased this unit to cool the hottest part of my house and it has worked great. I was very surprised to see the temperature go down to 61°. I ended up putting this in my room so it would be easier to control air flow throughout the day and night. Being someone who loves a cool room for sleeping and having no problems sleeping with other air conditioners on the coldest setting all night, this A/C was WAY colder than I was expecting. I almost froze with this unit on 61°!!!When it comes to things like this, I believe that having too much is just right and this unit is perfect! My house is small and essentially just a bunch of rooms so I have to use fans to get airflow throughout the house and this unit provides the power and cold air to make it possible to cool the entire house comfortably. In conjunction with another small A/C and the right conditions, I can get my house nearly 15-20° cooler than the outside air temperature.The dual hose works so much better than my other single hose unit. Don't even bother wasting your money on the single hose if you can afford this. You can really tell the difference when the temperatures get high. The dual hose unit just keeps pumping out super cold air like a walk in the park.Having the unit in my room means that it gets VERY cold VERY fast so the remote is a must have in my situation so I don't have to get out of my bed into a freezing cold room in the middle of the night to turn it off. In short, the remote is my friend.Installation wasn't difficult but, I know my way around tools and have had a lot of experience installing and uninstalling window mounted units over the years. Having various sized window foam, shims, and experience will definitely help but, not sure if necessary or not because all windows will come with their own set of challenges. My windows were out of plumb so, extra foam was needed in the gap when pushed tight to the unit.On a final note, make sure that the window mount that the tubes connect to from the back of the unit is turned the right way for the tubes to connect to....I had mine turned around to the outside and couldn't figure out what I did wrong when I was ready for the main event. So, just check that very important detail because the directions are not helpful on that one as they should be.Awesome unit! Super happy and would recommend this to anyone who is done messing around with window mounted units. This A/C is powerful, super cold, and very easily movable. A no-brainer if you have the extra money to spend. Also, I DON'T use the dehumidify option and I've not had one drop of water to deal with so that has been a great relief. 2 thumbs up here!!👍👍",

    "reviewText": "I received the unit about a week ago and have already installed it but have not used it in a hot day yet. The air conditioner looks pretty good and is not too loud when working. My only gripe with it is that when it is not working there is noise like a fan and it is constant. I have it in my bedroom and it will be problematic. I have contacted whynter and I am hoping I can find a solution. I just don't know if there is supposed to be a constant whinding sound even when the unit is off. I measured the power consumption when it is on standby and it showed 1.6watts. The remote is also nice but not intuitive and it doesn't sense the air tempreture.",

Furthermore, it also worked well in our 800 sq. ft. 2nd level room of our townhouse unit.The only flaw of this product is the window kit. It is short when putting it vertically and we still need to buy an extra window kit just to fill the window gap.The price is also a bit high that we paid as much as $1400. The price is doubled compared to other online stores like Wayfair.",

    "reviewText": "*Update - the company has been unhelpful and outright lazy in trying to troubleshoot my unit not working. They asked me to ship the unit back for repairs. If anyone has guessed, the cost of packaging and shipping something this big to another country is astronomical in comparison to the price paid for a unit that lasted about 1 year. They must know their product is no good - hence the 1 year warranty on the unit and the measly 3 year on the converter. From what I’ve seen from other’s experiencing the same - especially in Canada - this item will cost you SO much more than the price tag and a lot of headaches. Not to mention being down almost a grand and without AC in the middle of summer. You’ve been warned*Worked great last summer. Maintained it well, stored approximately over winter. Took it out this spring and it worked for 2 months before it completely stopped cooling the air. Follower all the troubleshooting and contacted the company who refuses to speak on the phone. After 6 “troubleshooting” emails back and forth, I’m still stuck with a glorified fan in the middle of summer. I’d expect a lot more support and performance after spending almost a thousand dollars. Buyer beware",

    "reviewText": "The evaporative cooling technology is old-school and under the right conditions it works great. This is NOT an air conditioner, so if you are expecting something similar to a window unit or car AC you will be disappointed. It can't cool down a large, hot room. But what it can do, it does really well!Where I live it can get really dry. My husband and I sleep in an upstairs bedroom that is always 10 degrees warmer than the rest of the house. In the winter if we lower the heater temperature, our daughter gets cold downstairs in her room. In the Sumner if we try to cool off the upstairs with our central AC, it freezes the downstairs. I have vintage windows that won't hold a window unit, and if I open a window at night to sleep, my allergies go crazy.This little cooler has been amazing to both drop the temperature and raise the humidity. Plus, the drier the air, the cooler it gets. Evap coolers dont work well in humid climate at all. I found that out when I lived in Texas.I put a thermometer directly in front of the grill of the EvaChill as it was blowing, and in my 85 degree room with 21% humidity the air coming out was 68 degrees! I put the cooler right next to our bed, on my side, blowing across us... and my husband had to pull up the covers because it was cold.I cannot say enough great things about this little machine. A full reservoir of water lasts about 3 hours in dry conditions. The tank is super easy to fill. It is cute and modern and small and innocuous. The fan is quiet and practically nonexistent compared to my air purifier. The highest setting makes quite a breeze, and the lowest is perfect to just humidify the air. It pumps out way more moisture than my cool mist humidifier. I LOVE not waking up with dry eyes.I keep it next to the bed, but it would be great in a hot office or cubicle, too. I have only had it a few weeks and I use it every night, so I'm hoping it lasts. Its like falling asleep in an ocean breeze. And a treat for anyone who suffers from hot flashes or night sweats. I LOVE EvaChill!",

    "reviewText": "For starters, if you're looking for something to cool an entire room, this is NOT the purchase to make!! That being said though, this is perfect if you need something to set up near you while sitting at a desk or something local like that. The air isn't freezing by any means, but it's definitely cool air and feels nice. It's pretty energy efficient, easy to use, and the noise isn't bad! It can get a bit loud on the 4th (highest) setting, but it's not an annoying sound in my opinion. I do wish there was a line to show the max level the water can be because when I first got it I did make the mistake of overfilling it, so make sure you turn on the light to make it easy to see the water level as you're filling it up. Otherwise, I have no real complaints about it! As long as you're realistic in understanding that it's for cooling a localized area rather than an entire room (unless that room is very small,) it works great for what it's meant to do and I'd say is worth the purchase now that I'm entering my second summer of using it!",

    "reviewText": "First allow me to say what the headline clearly states: This is not an air conditioner in any way, shape, or form. If you are seeking something that is going to cool a room down, this is not the product that is going to miraculously do that for you. In fact, I have searched high and low for a product that was like that only to realize that such things don't exist unless you have a window unit or a the very least a window for ventilation tubing that connects to a true portable AC unit.However, as a simple little desktop fan, it's not bad. I don't think it is worth the cost, nor do I believe in all the hype this product received when it became available. But it isn't terrible. I could have bought something far cheaper and probably received a product that did the same thing. I would also like to note, that when I first received the item, it was defective, and I had to return it for a replacement. Still, I do think it is decent for what it is. And when compared to a regular fan of the same size, the water and filter aspect of this will give you a cooler breeze, just not a life changing one.",

    "reviewText": "The Evapolar evaCHILL saved me a summer ago when there was a crazy heat wave in Oregon. Whew, it was hot. This helped me as a work from home so I just had this pointed at myself and helped keep me cool.Extremely portable and easy to refill. I have since used this on trips or just to have some extra coolness without running the AC. The real star of why I think the product is worth the hype is due to Basalt fibers. A list of some features of using them below as to why I purchased:⭐️ High Thermal Stability: Basalt fibers have excellent resistance to high temperatures, making them suitable for use in air conditioning systems where components may be exposed to heat.✅ Vibration Dampening: Basalt fibers have good vibration-dampening properties, which can reduce noise and improve the overall user experience of a portable AC. This helped keep it quiet to me.✅ Eco-Friendly: Basalt is a naturally occurring material, and the production of basalt fibers is more environmentally friendly compared to some synthetic fibers, making portable AC units more sustainable.✅ Corrosion Resistance: Basalt fibers are resistant to corrosion, chemicals, and moisture, which is beneficial in the harsh environments often encountered by air conditioning units.✅ Lightweight: Despite their strength, basalt fibers are relatively lightweight, which is ideal for portable AC units that need to be easily movable.Hope this helps.",

I used this last Friday and it was 90 degrees out. I put water in it and used it for a couple hours. I actually turned it off a couple times because the mister and fan made me \"cold.\" I made sure I charged it for a couple hours because I also read that some of these don't hold their charge. I didn't experience anything negative about the unit. I did turn the light off (it has a button to select a number of different colors if using at night) to not waste the battery and didn't have the fan on high the entire time, both battery saving techniques. The misters work well but you'll struggle to feel them if it's windy and it's not right next to you. You can always hold it and it works great! I put cold water in the unit and the mist was nice and cold and blown on me by the fan. All in all, I have no complaints about this thing and it worked exactly the way I hoped it would. Looking forward to using it the next time!",

What you want is fan power and mist power and 90% of them are crap in both categories.This one delivers with great mist and great fan power. In addition it's water tank is much larger than most. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the fan blows upward and there isn't a way to direct the flow. So on a night stand it goes over your head. I put something under the back edge to solve the problem.This is the third one I tried and is the only one worth getting. The other little box ones, or the ones with special hexagon lattice inside, and the one which shows you a refrigerator coil which it doesn't actually have are garbage. They don't put out enough air flow or mist to do anything. Get this one!!",

    "reviewText": "Small but kind of powerful. This fan indoors gets really cool and does a good job cooling off. However we took this outdoors to my son's soccer game and it didn't live up to the hype as much. It did provide airflow as if it was slightly windy, however it wasn't able to get cool. Please note I have not tried with ice or water yet. For that reason I'm giving it 3 stars. But as for being able to take it remotely anywhere you think you may be hot, this is great to move wherever. Charging does take 6 hours, best to do overnight.",

    "reviewText": "Controlling this unit using an app on my phone is an excellent option - I can start the A/C on my way home from work, adjusting temp, fan speed, mode, etc. Installation was easy, except for cryptic instructions on how to hook up to WiFi. (Hint: holding the FAN button for 3 seconds is the \"Reset button\").Using this to cool about 250 sq ft bedroom / sitting room. Certainly has enough cooling power for my needs. Now I can turn down (or even turn off) the house's air conditioner which used to run day and night without cooling the upstairs very well. The noise level is as expected, but certainly is not too loud.Shipping took 3 more days than the 20 days originally estimated for free UPS Ground service. Wait time was excessive and they would receive 2 stars (if this category existed) because of the delays and since the packaging was very banged up when we received it. The unit itself came through unharmed. I would recommend this unit.",

It cools everything off in such a short amount of time, doesn’t take up too much space or too much electricity, and is not too bad on the noise front either! In fact, unless we’re making it work every extra hard on those really hot days, we don’t hear it—AT ALL! So yes, it CAN get noisy when it’s 38 degrees Celsius outside and it’s bringing it down to 23 in the whole house, but otherwise it’s pretty quiet.For us it cools our entire two floors—but keep in mind we live in an open concept, 1150 SQ FT 2 storey loft so that makes a difference.The remote works great! No trouble there. My partner uses it more than me and he’s really happy with it.For a portable AC, we find it cools MORE than other alternatives. We did go with the more expensive option ($800) and don’t regret it.You DO get what you pay for!! Would not recommend a cheaper alternative, personally.",

I haven't tried the phone e- connection so I can't comment on that. But it nicely cools my large living/dining/hall in 80-90F weather. I also like the fan only air filter option.

Came in 2 days and so far it was definitely worth it. Nice size to the model. It has a nice weight, definitely not cheap plastic. It even came with a remote!I had to fanagel the setup a little bit because my window is too small to fit the full window blocker but it still works really well. The air is definitely a/c cold. Only goes down to 60 def F though. The fans in the AC are really powerful. Perfect for those who enjoy that background noise at night. Would definitely recommend!!!",

At $250 during Prime days the unit is worth it if it continues to function well.Update: opened the cabin today and turned on the heater. It gave only cold air and the unit iced up. Yes, the heater iced up the unit. It’s worthless as a heater. Will wait for the heat of summer to see if at least the AC works.Update on update: when the unit is properly vented all modes (heat, ac, dehumidifier, and fan) function well. Excellent product.",

No it's not quiet at all.Good luck sleeping with this on, It's about as quiet as the food court at a mall on a Saturday. (Slight exaggeration but you get the point). Maybe its just because I like to sleep in silence.It would be nice if it would turn off the blower once the room temp has been reached but I have yet to have that happen. \"Night Mode\" just locks the settings. One thing to note, you may want to insulate the exhaust hose with a blanket (preferably wool for fire resistance) as the hose gets quite warm. The drain tank is not removable, it drains through a little valve at the bottom. They do include a silicone hose to drain the water which is nice.I ordered this one because my AC went out and this was cheap and had 2 day shipping. Not to mention my window is mostly blocked by a desk so this style works great.Overall not a terrible AC unit, just not for noise sensitive people.",

    "reviewText": "I never usually write reviews but I feel ripped off & want to help someone else find another ac unit instead of this one!!I used this occasionally for 3 summer months in 2023, I always cleaned it & put it away in an indoor closet for the fall/winter. I took it out today & it has not been blowing cool air at all. It’s recycling the air but the “cool” function is not working. I have tried everything the manual says to fix the problem with no avail. I don’t have $240 each summer to buy a new ac unit for my apartment. This should work for longer than 3 months of occupational usage considering the unit is indoors unlike most others that are exposed to the elements !Noise level- loud ! Even on the sleep setting it is noisy , you can’t hear anything over it. Which is fine for someone like me that enjoys loud fans but for my partner , they prefer it to be quiet.Installation- I have standard windows that slide up, the piece that pops into the window & then into the hose is too big . I had to duct tape it to the window sill & to the hose to hold it all into place.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Loud and just okay.",
    "reviewText": "Given time, this unit will definitely cool down a room, the difference between the temperature is noticeable, and if you let it run for multiple hours without stopping, it will get noticeably chilly even. It does work, but that being said, the unit is INCREDIBLY loud. I have to turn my phone volume to near maximum in order to hear anything. The loudness is in fact so bothering that It becomes complicated to watch tv without worrying that the volume of the tv will bother the downstairs neighbors. This can be remedied by investing in noise cancelling headphones, but I wish it could be quieter, sleep mode does not make a difference in sound level. Installation was complicated, I had to modify the panel by cutting part of it off in order for it to fit my window, after which it left a jagged looking edge on the panel. The hose was easy to put on and install. The remote control feels relatively cheap, but it does indeed perform its intended function. The unit is fairly compact all things considered. The fan speed is okay, but nothing incredibly impressive. I will note that the fan sometimes sounds like it’s scraping. Overall the unit will cool your room to a comfortable level, but you should expect this unit to have noticeable problems. (Auto evaporation function works, review based on mid 80s to low 90s weather) I will say that I expected more from this, it exudes a very cheap vibe. This is a very good example of “you get what you pay for” I would urge anyone looking at this to explore better options before you find yourself wanting something better.",

    "reviewText": "If you’re looking for a super easy and effective AC unit, this is the one! This is the second portable from this brand that we have bought. Our central unit works when it wants too, and just doesn’t keep up with this Texas heat. We have a 10,000btu in our kitchen and the 12,000btu in our living room where it is large open space, and it has made our house much more comfortable. Not only is it portable (which means it can go camping with us, or can easily be moved to another room by rolling instead of having to carry it), it also has 4 different functions including AC for when it’s hot and heater for when it’s cold. It’s not super heavy, but works better than the wall unit we initially tried. It comes with a window connection to vent the hot air out also which was a little challenging at first, but we trimmed it a bit and it works like a charm. The connector is very sturdy also, so if you are like me and have a pet that likes to try to sneak out of the house from the seal sides, they cant wiggle the side panels loose!",

Esta unidad funciona bien. Es más pesado de lo que esperaba y no es especialmente silencioso, pero hace un buen trabajo al enfriar mi oficina.

Not too noisy, rotating fins create a soft movement of air in the room. I do add ice packs to just drop the temp a few degrees and it’s great. The AC removes moisture, which is why it’s counter productive to run them at the same time, but the added moisture is just enough to keep my sinuses happy. Pick your times for firing this guy up and make summer more bearable!",

    "reviewText": "My portable AC decided to stop working mid August 2023. My tiny camper windows won't allow me to use a window AC. I needed something to help keep my camper cool in Missouri mid August. So I used my last bit of money to buy this Evaporative cooler. I was expecting normal Missouri August temps but this August in 2023 had massive heatwave in store for me. I have an elderly 13 year old dog and a cat that I've raised from puppy and kitten. Everyplace that I could have gone to stay cool wouldn't allow my pets. If we can't stay cool together we broil together. This Evaporative cooler has literally been a life saver. We are on day 4 of 100°F+ weather as I type this review. Yes it did make my camper a bit more humid but it normally kept my camper 3 - 10 degrees cooler than the outside temps. It may not sound like much but trust me 94°F in a wet fan feels much better than 110°F in the outside broiler that Missouri has become. My pets and I owe our lives to this cooler. I did try adding a bag of ice but it only lasted a few min and was a nice cool brief breeze. Today we will try ice packs.",

No low or medium speed, but high still works at least.Know what you're getting with an evaporative cooling fan.It's not an air conditioning unit and there's only so much it can do, especially in an already humid environment.I do like the fan, there's other similar fans on the market for lower cost, but this one is green and it matches my toolboxes lol.This is packaged very poorly with only a thin cardboard box and it came a bit beaten up from shipping.Nothing major though, just some dings in the plastic, still works fine and does not leak.I'm a heavy equipment mechanic in East Texas, so there's an absurd amount of dust in our shop, extreme heat, and high humidity majority of the time.It does cool down the temperature a few degrees on the drier days, others it just makes everything feel more wet.I've only had it for a few months so far, but it's holding up well despite the dusty environment.Strong fan for the size, it will blow itself backwards unless the wheels are locked or it has water inside.",

Maybe buy some plastic tubing for continuous draining to empty into a flat, lipped container to empty at your convenience. Drains about a cup total, a day",

    "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024",
    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is my 3rd portable AC but my first Black & Decker",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. MY ⭐️RATINGS:5⭐️- EXCEEDS MY EXPECTATIONS!TOP QUALITY & MUST HAVE!‼️UPDATE: 12/04/2024‼️HEAT SETTINGI must ensure that everyone knows how this device truly works. As I said in the headline, this is our third portable AC unit.It is now December, so we have frigid nights. This unit is heat and AC. At night, it gets so cold in the room. We turned the heat on to 66°, warming the room perfectly.EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:If you want the heat to run correctly, you must ensure that the room you use it in has humidity between 45% and 55%. The heater needs to draw moisture to heat correctly. If you run the unit on heat in a very dry room, it will not heat properly.I ordered the Dreo Smart Humidifiers for Bedroom, 6L Top Fill Supersized Cool Mist Humidifier for Large Room, 500 sq ft. to make sure the room has a proper climate.Unlike the AC unit, the heater cannot disperse the water from the air hose like when the AC portion is running. One difference between using AC and heat is that you will 100% have to empty the water reservoir a lot more when the heat is running.I cannot believe I must specify this, but let me do it anyway. You can attach the clear hose to have it run the water into a pan instead of emptying it so much. However, do not let the water run outside. It will freeze, and the water coming from the hose could freeze. I am specifying and telling others about these various ways because this is the United States, and people don't care to take the time to research how to use a product.UPDATE 06/26/2024:(See pix with UPDATE 06/26/2024 on it)99° outside and only 70.2° in our room above the garage. The other unit from a different brand never would have kept the room this cool. Those who claim the unit doesn’t work or is not cooling for them need to review the manual and check the hose or location where they placed the unit. I have had zero problems with it and am delighted with my purchase.UPDATE 06/03/2024:We have had hot temps over the last four days, and I am beyond happy with this unit. It is 4:08 pm and 68.6° in our bedroom. Outside, it is 87°. I mentioned the time because the sun is beating on the side of the house, and last year, we couldn’t keep the room below 77° with our other brand of portable AC unit. It has run all day, which is expected, but at night, it keeps the room cool and doesn’t run all night.UPDATE: 05/11/2024The dehumidifier works GREAT! We have had numerous storms lately due to hot weather. Of course, rain and hot weather make for humid, sticky conditions. When the Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Gauge says 60%, it’s time to use the dehumidifier. Each time I used it, about 2 hours later, the humidity in the room dropped to about 54-55%, which is within the range for summer. I must drain the unit once weekly if I’ve used the dehumidifier.Our bedroom is over our three-car garage; it is 425 sq—for the main bedroom and two closets. The central AC works fine for the bathroom. Even with a new heat pump for upstairs, it still doesn't cool or heat our main bedroom.Firstly, I wasn’t playing around when ordering a new unit. I did my research. CONSUMER REPORTS, READ OVER 1,000 REVIEWS, and a recommendation from a TRUSTED STRAMFITTER (HVAC) guy. With the reviews, I noticed several things: most of the negative reviews were from frustrated people who, had they taken care of the device correctly, it would still be working. ALL portable AC units need DIY maintenance. Clean the filter and drain the unit at least once every 30 days in high humidity or every 90 days in low humidity. Even though it says EVAPORATION, it still needs to be drained. Another issue is that people ignore what they are ordering and then blame it on the companies when it is their lack of attention. Complaining and writing a review about a product they never used seems pointless. Remember, this is an investment; if something is missing when you open it, return it within 30 days and get a replacement. It’s that easy.I have 2 Digital Hygrometer Indoor Thermometer Humidity Gauge in the room. I placed one furthest from the unit and one on the unit. This way, I always know the temp & humidity in the room.THE SOUND: (WATCH VIDEO)The sound is EXACTLY as it is supposed to be. Those who stated it was too loud have never used an indoor portable AC unit. It’s not the same as a window unit. Window units have the motor and fans OUTSIDE the window, so the sound is different. If you stand outside next to a window unit when it is on, it is LOUD. Basically, the portable AC is quieter as a whole.THE WINDOW KIT: (See Pictures)This could be a little better. It almost didn’t fit my STANDARD window. I never use the FOAM that comes with the unit. I purchased weather-friendly, long-lasting foam instead. The foam they provide will get dried out and become dust.THE REMOTE:Very easy to use. Follow the manual.THE DISPLAY:Easy to understand & operate. Follow the manual.THE HEAT:Heats our room perfectly. We only keep it set at 68° because there isn’t a need for any warmer.THE A/C:Our bedroom is 425 sq ft, over a garage, and the sun beats in 2 of the four windows so badly that we had to black them out with Blackout Window Static Cling with White Side, Total Blackout Window. This unit cools the room rapidly and keeps it comfortable.I like that once the room reaches my chosen temperature, it shuts down but comes back on when it warms up by 1.0°. My other units ran non-stop. This functions more like an AC/HEAT PUMP.I’m impressed so far, and if anything changes, I will update this review to let others interested in purchasing this device know.This portable AC is exactly as advertised, well-made, and works well. The PRICE is in the usual range.",

    "reviewRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
    "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023",
    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great little unit for what it does.",
    "reviewText": "I work from home. My home office, with all its computer equipment, heats up considerably. The office is always 15-20° warmer than the outdoor temp. In the summer, 90° outside can easily mean the office is 100-110°. Ouch. Not only is 100° an uncomfortable work environment, but it's dangerously hot for any computer equipment.Small 12x12 former bedroom -- I originally tried a Honeywell 8,000BTU unit. I gave up on that after a month or so and gave that unit away. It could not cool the room, due to the computer equipment, despite the unit running pretty much constantly.I then upgraded and for the past several years I've been running a Wynter 14,000 BTU portable AC. It was loud, but it did the job of cooling the room. The condenser burnt out about 6 months ago, but it would still blow cooler air and suck the hot air out of the room. So I continued to use it until I found a replacement. It never really got \"cold\" without the condenser functioning (and no one wanted to repair it) but would easily cool the room to a more livable temp - around 80°. However, it ran almost constantly in summer months. So my electric bills easily climbed by $100+ each month.Naturally, I decided to replace the old unit, which was breaking down, and decided on this Black&Decker 14,000BTU unit. The B&D unit EASILY cools the room in a few minutes and keeps it cool all day (cooling, then shutting off, then kicking back on several minutes later). Overall the B&D unit is much quieter than previous units I've owned. Of course there's the sound of the fan/rushing air when it's running, and there's a loud \"ca-chunk\" when it starts up the condenser (as expected). But, unlike previous units, I can still talk on the phone 5 feet away without having to first shut the unit off.In addition, the hose attachment on the back of the unit is LIGHT YEARS better than any previous unit I've seen. I do not want to have to install dual hoses for venting. So I will only look at/use one hose units.I always had trouble with hoses staying connected to the units. The \"unit-to-hose connectors\" other manufactures proved were a COMPLETE joke with no actual \"locking\" ability.. it was like resting a tissue on an outdoor picnic table and not expecting it to blow off. The hose would fall off then the unit would simply be blow hot air into the room rather than venting it out - actually heating the room as opposed to cooling it. I previously had to wrap the vent hose with a considerable amount of duct tape in order to keep it actually attached to the unit.The hose connection on the back of the B&D unit is SO MUCH BETTER and fool-proof. It essentially locks in place and stays put. No more worries about the host falling off. I like this feature a great deal, even though it's such a minor thing.My ONLY real complaint is the remote control. Not in its functionality, but in its design. The LCD screen REALLY needs some sort of illumination. Forget about reading the remote screen in a dimly lit room. I really dislike how dark the screen on the remote control is. But, it's not like I need to read the remote screen repeatedly or even frequently. I can live with it. But if they wanted to improve anything, it would be the illumination of the remote screen.I can't yet speak about longevity of the unit. I tend to use a portable AC every day, 14-16hrs, from about April through to about October.. and I got this B&D unit in Aug of this year. I would expect it to last at least 5 years, if not much longer. My last 14,000BTU unit lasted a decade before it started breaking down. If I factor in the cost over a 10 year lifespan, it's well worth it when considering at a per-year breakdown.I also can't directly speak about electric costs, as I've not had the B&D unit long enough to make an adequate comparison. However, since the B&D unit shuts off for several minutes after cooling, rather than continuously running, I would anticipate energy costs to be much lower than I've previously experienced. But I do consider any energy costs to be a necessary evil to both keep computer equipment at healthy temperatures and to not have to work in a 90° office.Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. I was strongly looking at this unit for a few weeks weeks, researching, then it hit some sort of sale at Amazon and I purchased it for much a lower price through Amazon than I could have from ANY other retailer. I did shop around several online retailers for this same model and Amazon had the lowest price by literally hundreds of dollars at the time.",

    "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024",
    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Does its job well, but with drainage drawback.",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros: Arrived quick and packaged well. Very easy set up, though I suppose that depends on your window. It def heats your space up, and fairly quickly- which is excellent. It is a reasonable volume for what it’s doing. Used for AC for a short period, same- it cooled space well. Looks decent and exactly as pictured.Cons: the biggest negative is how the heat setting produces TONS of water in the machine that requires draining, and the drain hole is at the very bottom. A hose is provided that is useless, because you cannot create a suction, and therefore you cannot use a bucket. So, unless you elevate your machine on blocks, you only have about a half inch to work with. Ironically the water space in the machine must go below the drainage hole because you have to pick up and slightly tilt the machine to FULLY empty it. I used an old baking tray to allow continuous drainage, which looks terrible, but if the height is above the hole, then it will not drain and the machine will shut off. Like literally, if the water catching bin is the slightest bit higher than the hole the hose isn’t working, lol. The amount of water does decrease some as the machine runs, but not enough to ignore the design flaw.There is also some leakage from the exhaust tube. With AC the exhaust is hot air. With Heat running the exhaust is cold air. I recommend taping the connection points where exhaust is to reduce air escape/blow back.Unknown: I can’t comment on the price but I am certain it will be less than my electric baseboard several decades old. Saving $$ is also why I got this machine and getting it on sale def seems worth it if my monthly bill goes down significantly. The house is loads warmer too.4 stars because it works as described and looks decent. 1 star off because of the drainage being a big PITA.",

I don't need it inside my house because we have AC. BUT instead of cooling my garage down it made it HOTTER AND SO HUMID. I work in my garage and was starting to feel sick from the heat when I realized the instructions say you can't use it in an enclosed space. It didn't say that anywhere on the page before I bought it. Now I can't even return it so I just wasted SO MUCH MONEY on something I CANT EVEN USE. Really disappointed. Hope to save people from wasting money on this in the future.",

    "reviewText": "By \"med - large room\" I mean the difference between a reg bedroom or a living room/dining area together. I filled the tank, set it on 3 (out of 4) and the entire living room/dining area was cooled off withing 1-2 hours and I live on the sunny side of a building. It gets really hot here. I then turned it down to a 2 and that's where it 's been for a week. The ice packs didn't do much. They take up room for needed water. I put 2 - 64oz bottles of water in the fridge and pour one in the tank when it gets below half a tank. You can easily see the water level on the front. If it cools off at night, you can turn off the water pump to save water but it still evaporates over time. I like the moist air at night for my sinuses.It's not silent but it's pretty quiet. A definite positive.I really like this fan but here's 1-2 bad things.The display on top turns off (lights go off) so at night I can't see what settings it's on until you press buttons on the remote or the fan itself. If it had a motion sensor on top to light up when it detects your hand, that would be great.As stated, the ice packs didn't make much difference if you're putting cold water in there regularly. They took room away for more water.Only one issue from a handicapped/wheelchair POV: The release for the tank on the back is all the way at the bottom near the base. It's hard for me to bend that low to open the back tank but it opens easily and closes/secures easily. It's also an issue for me to see the top of the fan controls easily. For someone standing over it, it's perfect. For someone who's eyes are basically level with the top, it's a little difficult but not too bad. Just a LITTLE annoying.I still recommend it. It's the best fan I've bought in years and is pretty quiet.",

    "reviewText": "I think it’s widely known this is a top performing brand but what unique (in my opinion) is that this fan has a compartment for its ice pack (provided) so it blows ice cold air while the ice lasts. The ice does not last long on really warm days but does blow cold air for about two hours. Additional ice packs would be helpful.",

    "reviewText": "Bought this to keep me comfortable on the front porch during the Florida summers while I make Internet's and smoke cigars; it worked almost as well as I hoped.The bad: I wish it got a bit cooler. It does a nice job and for the most part does what I hoped. There were a couple days that a few degrees cooler would have made the difference but it still.did a great job as I would have been too uncomfortable to sit out for a few hours.The good: it blows a large amount of cool, dry, air that is very directional - a foot in either direction and you will loose the bubble of comfort. The condensation reservoir is substantial and generally will allow me to run it for 3 or so hours - in Florida humidity - before needing to be emptied. The wheels make it easy to move around; it is a bit heavy to lift but not unmanageable. I often make phone calls and conference calls while on patio and the unit is not so noisy to be noticeable or hamper patio conversion.If you are looking to solve a similar problem, this unit works very well.",

I'll be running it outside my tent and simply piping the cool are outlet hose it.I'm going to add an extension hose to the outlet and possibly the drain.

So I figured I'd try this portable AC - maybe it might help.To my surprise, it's a breath of fresh air. Or should I say a breath of cool breeze? Don't get me wrong - it's not like I'm sitting in an air-conditioned room. But the cool breeze blasting at me is downright refreshing! It makes my time sitting at a desk in a blazing hot Florida warehouse tolerable. What a relief... I'm extremely pleased!",

    "reviewText": "Thus is the most powerful evaporative cooler I have ever owned, over ther years, I have bought about 3, but none of them work as efficiently as this one. I bought this one for my business, because we are on the corner, at a certain part of the day,the sun beams down heavily on the building causing the bricks to heat up like a brick I oven. I have two air conditioners running at all times because it is a salon and we have heated equipment running. When it is really hot, when turn off and equipment when we are not using it. This cooler helps cool off any excess hot air in the salon area. I also use fans to circulate the cooler air. It works extremely well, if you turn it off, you notice the difference immediately. Many customers have inquired about the unit, because they can actually feel the cool air from it. If it is extremely humid outside, you will not get the same cooling affect when the humidity is low, but it still makes a difference. The only downside to this unit is, because it is so powerful and I use it on high, it sucks down alot of water quickly. I can't go past 6-8 hours without adding more water. If you work an 8hour day, you definitely have to fill it up every day with about 4 gallons of water. If you use this unit outside in your yard, there is a garden hose attachment on the side of the unit, so you never run out of water. This is by far the best evaporative cooler I have ever bought, and I am looking forward to early Fall and late Spring, where I can just open my windows and turn it on, and not use the air conditioners at all. It is very sturdy, you can put ice directly into the water opening and, there is no spike in my electric bill from using it.",

    "reviewText": "I bought two of these at different times. The first one came with the fan wire detached so the fan didn't work at all but I just opened it up and attached it and everything worked again. I actually did a replacement prior to \"fixing\" it myself but ended up not needing to get the replacement after all. It cools the room down after a while. You can feel the coolness instantly but it'll take time to actually keep the room cool, which is natural. Overall, I'm satisfied with both units I got. They keep my home nice and comfortable when the outside temperature is in the 90s.",

    "reviewText": "I have the cooler located in a well covered and shaded outside area for my outside pets here in the Southwest. Had to replace cooler pump at two months (June - July) of daily 14 hour use. If used a lot, or use is of any importance, I recommend keeping a new spare cooler pump on hand. Shopping around will show that replacement cooler pumps are readily available, ranging from $18 to $43. Cooler pump replacement is fairly easy with videos available online. I will have this cooler going 14 hours a day thru August, possibly September.The overall size is convenient and will fit just about anywhere. For me, supplying water via the hose attachment is an absolute necessity, but the float valve only allows the water level to rise just high enough to completely cover the cooler pump, about 1/4 of the tanks capacity. The existing float is fixed, but adjustable floats are available from Hessaire.I am disappointed in the plastic used for the housing as it seems to be brittle, so I am very careful with it. I never pick the cooler up by the provided handle if there is water in the cooler as I am not convinced the housing could take it.For the money, I think it does a pretty good job. I think I might have been happier paying a little more for a more durable, higher end, higher output model, since it is only used in extreme outside conditions (108F to 118F).",

    "reviewText": "I purchased the Hessaire MC18V a couple weeks ago to use in what can be a very hot sunroom that houses my cat. There is a long bank of windows that face east that allow the morning sun on summer days to become brutally hot. The poor cat needed some relief. I bought the Hessaire after much research and contemplation. The model I bought fit my budget...I thought after reading reviews it would be adequate for the space. Setting it up was simple...put on the wheels, fill with water, switch it on. From that moment the Hessaire began cooling the sunroom and is keeping it in the high 70s most days. To maximize the evaporative cooling system I open several windows behind the Hessaire and down the line of windows in front of the MC18V I open every third window. I also run a Vornado fan to move the air around. The evaporative cooling system is working better than I'd hoped. It's not too noisy on high fan and the quieter low fan setting is adequate most days. There hasn't been any issue with excess humidity (probably because there are several open windows). I am happy with this purchase so far. It's easy to put water in using a watering can with long narrow spout. Rolling the unit to put it away each evening is easy. I decided to drain the Hessaire after the first week. The drain is accessible and easy to use. I have been adding a half cup of white vinegar to the water every third day. I haven't noticed any foul odors. I have no complaints other than the not so beautiful army green color is not my favorite. I do recommend this product.",

Fan pulls Outside air in though the pad and into the room.Only difference is the fan is on the other end of the dairy barn exhausting and pulling outside air through through the pad.not blowing into the barn.If it just circulated inside air though the pad it wouldn’t cool and if there was no exhaust it would be a soupy mess lol. If the air going thru the pad is not dry and it’s humid then there will be little to no evaporation occurring on the pad and thus no evaporative cooling effectIf you’re in a dry place this will come in handy don’t need anything there just turn it on.",

    "reviewText": "I live in the Seattle area and work from home - my 10x10 office gets hot. When it's 70 outside, my office can be 80+ from 11 am to 5 pm. I got this unit several weeks ago and though it's June when I'm writing this (and it hasn't gotten truly hot yet this year) I've been really happy with it.The fan mode draws in fresh air from outside and often times this is all I need.The AC works great and I'm taking phone calls in the same room with it. It makes some noise but not an obnoxious amount.The dehumidifier mode produces over 12 ounces of water an hour and this is my fav mode. It puts out ice box cold air while drawing a lot of the moisture out of the apartment.Set up required no tools and was easy.It took me a few tries to figure out how to use the timer function, but now I use it. I can have the unit come on an hour before I start work, so the room is nice and comfortable.I haven't used the sleep timer yet.The only con I found: the drain for the dehumidifier is located on the bottom and the unit sits really close to the floor. I couldn't figure out how to drain it without making a mess, so I built a pedestal out of some scrap and elevated the unit. Now it sits higher and I can put a container underneath to drain the water into.Over all, I am happy enough with it that I am buying a second one for my bedroom.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Cools Great, but is Pretty Loud",
    "reviewText": "I took a lot of this review from other Amazonian because I agree with all of it and it is worth repeating.\"I did a ton of research trying to figure out if I even wanted a portable AC. I needed it for a room with west facing windows that gets blasted with direct sunlight the entire afternoon/early evening. Window units became very inefficient during really hot days and thought a portable solution would help. And it definitely has! But.... you need to know certain things in order to get the most out of this.Firstly, any review that mentions you don't need to worry about attaching a hose to drain excess water that builds up is 100% wrong. You MUST attach a hose for this for it to work properly. It'll turn on and work fine for short period of time until the water reservoir inside this fills up and causes it to shut off. If you're on the east coast with humid summers, this will fill up with water and will need to drain out in roughly 10-15 minutes after turning it on. I got lucky and just happened to have a hose from an old kitchen sink sprayer. It fit in there perfectly. The small holes on the plastic attachment that the exhaust hose attaches to that goes in your window can easily be widened using a scissor and slowly spinning/burrowing it to grind the hole big enough for the hose. Got my drainage hose through that hole and under the screen of my window to drain outside. Works perfectly.Secondly, the exhaust hose leaks out a bunch of heat from the hot air if fully expanded. If your plan is to get one of these and the exhaust hose just barely reaches the window there will be a noticeable amount of heat given off. The closer to the window the better and if you can find a safe way to prop it up off the ground so it's closer to the height of the window, I highly recommend that and it'll also make it easier to run the drain hose outside. I have mine setup to where the exhaust hose is barely expanded, which makes it thicker and allows less heat to escape, where the AC unit is roughly 15-20 inches from the window. I have these old wooden speaker stands I made that can easily support this AC unit and keeps it about 2 feet off the ground so the exhaust attachment on the back of the unit is even with the plastic attachment for the window. Ideally you want as straight of a line to the outside as possible for that hot exhaust air. And once you have the plastic attachment for the window installed, you'll wanna seal up any open cracks in between with tape.Last thing is using the Dehumidifier mode over regular AC mode. Mine didn't come with a manual so not sure if they both do the same thing but I always leave mine in Dehumidifier mode and works great that way. It blows out the same cold air and sucks all the moisture out of the air. Which if you live on the east coast, TRUST ME... You definitely want that. It's 94 degrees and miserable out today in Philadelphia and I'm perfectly comfortable. Look outside the window and the hose is just a continuous, fast drip. All that humidity ends up outside and makes it easier to keep the room comfortable. When I switch it to regular AC mode it doesn't seem as comfortable even though it blows out the same cold air. Not sure if it's just where I live and this room being on a 2nd floor but this works well for me in dehumidifier mode.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and this unit works well. It's a bit more noisy than I had hoped but all portable units are noisier than window units. It only makes sense when the whole thing being inside your room vs. most of it outside your window where sound will disperse away from your house. I see a lot of comments about how loud portable units are when these people don't seem to realize they're all like that. Even fancy, more expensive units will still be rather noisy. It's just how loud the fan is. So, beware of reviews by people who have limited knowledge on this sort of thing and just post their own narrowminded review of something like a portable AC unit, not understanding how it really works and what needs to happen to get the most out of one.",

    "reviewText": "This Denbig air conditioner is awsome. Cooling capability is great for our large master bedroom. Dehumidifier works even better than the cooling. I purchased a portable AC for our basement from Costco 3 years ago. I barely get a small trickle of water out of the reservoir when it is in dehumidify mode. This Denbig AC dehumidifies quickly and the reservoir fills up quickly. The unit comes with a rubber hose to attach for constant draining into a larger bucket so you don't have to worry about emptying the built in reservoir every hour. I have been running dehumidify over night and the temperature in the room drops down to a chilly \"great for sleeping\" temp in the mid 60's. Easy and quick to install. Love the wheels that make it easy to move around. Window kit is ok, a little flimsy (compared to one in basememt) and the extension piece that was included leaves openings on the sides of the window that I had to seal with a little duck tape, might be in part design of our windows. It was also not long enough for our big bedroom window so I had to use the extension left over from our unit in the basement. Keep that in mind if you want to use it in a large window. However, the unit itself gets 5 stars from me. Window kit is minor issue. I do recommend it, much better performer than the noisier and less efficient unit i have in the basement. Very effective at cooling and dehumidifying and at a great price too.",

I have checked everything: dust, blockages, as well as letting it go in fan mode for ~10 minutes before switching it onto cool. Nothing works. The item was described as \"excellent\" refurbished; however, when I bought it I did note on the inside some crushed in parts of the condenser. It worked last year, so I figured it was fine. Nope.I absolutely cannot recommend a product that does not do the one thing I want it to do. Especially when it is so expensive. Two stars as the other one works I guess so maybe you will get lucky and yours does not break.",

Vented outside as required, and it's worry free cooling! Some other reviews have complained about the noise. It's an air-conditioner. They make a background white noise. If that bothers you, i don't know what to tell you! But AC units make noise. That's the way it is.I find it soothing and sleep well. Better than ever!",

    "reviewText": "I like the cooling of the Apex 700. It's also much quieter than my old evaporative cooler. I also like the fact that the intake and cooling vent are both on the front - which means it can be put in a corner without worrying about airflow. The hose intake is also on the back of the unit and out of the way.The unit is WiFi/app controllable, and can send status notifications to your phone. It was giving me some erroneous complaints about potential for overfilling for a few days, but those have gone away.The issue I've had with it - and almost sent it back over - is that it was leaking a significant amount of water. When I diagnosed the problem, I found that the cover for the evaporative media touches the media. When water gets to the front of the media, it wicks on over to that cover, then the path of least resistance for that water is to channel out of the unit and down onto the ground (or in my case, my patio's concrete slab).I don't know why the designers thought it was a good idea to have that front cover touch the cooling media that can have water on it, and not provide a path of least resistance for the water to wick back down into the unit rather than out onto the ground.Removing the cover over the evaporative media fixes the problem, but I think it would also work to space the cover out so it doesn't touch the media, cut the cover back, or add some kind of lip that extends down from the bottom of the grille that would wick the water down that way and back into the reservoir rather than out and onto the ground.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great portable air conditioner!",
    "reviewText": "This unit is being used to cool down a master bedroom and it does a good job of doing it. You just have to eliminate the hot air that comes out of the exhaust tube in the back somehow. The exhaust tube it comes with is a little short at only about 5 ft. You can get creative with how you get rid of the hot air if you need more than 5 ft, as you can see in the photo. As a temporary solution, I cut up the box it came with for some extra distance in funneling the hot air to an unused room down the hall. This surprisingly does work but I do plan on purchasing an additional length of tubing to exhaust better than this temporary setup. Whatever you set the temperature to the unit will kick on the compressor when it needs to cool down and then it shuts off the compressor and lets the fan blow the remainder of the cold air out. This is good for energy management. You can also point the fans on the front up or down to direct the wind better. I've been using it for days now and I have not seen the warning that it is filled with water yet, so you probably don't have to dump the water out too often. I was worried that there may not be good customer service, but when I contacted them with an issue I had, they were quick to respond and helped me with my issue. This is a well-priced, portable air conditioner and it seems to be pretty well-built. Overall I would recommend it!",

Keep the plug for the water in,I thought having a bowl for it to drip into like how an a/c unit drips would be ok ill just empty the bowl lol ya don't do that woke up to a VERY wet carpet. Since plugging the hole no problems leaking. Haven't had to drain it either been using it for over 2 months now. Definitely recommend. Easy to install too. Don't need a big window opening either just big enough for the hose part. Comes with extenders for longer windows. I did line underneath with Styrofoam just for tighter seal.

    "reviewText": "I got this unit about in August of 2023. It's now June of 2024 and I've had the unit for less than a year. I used it in August and September of 2023. The unit produced cold air but was never able to cool off a whole room. I had 2 ACs and had to use them both. If you have an enclosed 10x10 area this unit would cool it off. Anything bigger and you'll need more BTUs.I didn't use it much in 2023 and turned it on again in 5/2024. I ran it pretty much everyday, 24/7 and 6/25/2024 the unit stopped producing cool air. The flow of water wasn't coming out anymore and I suspect a water pump might be broken. If you tip the unit and remove the excess water, then the unit starts cooling again. But you have to do it every 15 minutes manually. Otherwise the water doesn't come out and the unit stops cooling. So essential this unit is broken. I used it for about 4 months out of the year I had it. I just ordered another better dual hose unit from Amazon. So I have about a week of heat to bear. Buy at your own risk! Update - 06/24 The unit was not cooling off. Water would build up but then when you tilt the AC it would start blowing cool air again. And then the pump kicked in about 2 hours after of running it. Now it's working like before except I keep it at 70 degrees. Instead of 62 like before. Water comes out normally. And keep in mind I run this 24 7 non stop! So so far so good. Definitely worth the price... I'll keep you updated. Cancelled the other AC for now BTW.",

    "reviewText": "Its cool pretty great around 90 degrees. It casually brings down the room temperature by 7 degrees. Give it maybe 30 min to 40 min for a bedroom size. Kinda of big though, but its does it job. Remember this is not cold as an AC. The ice pack will drop the temperature 10 degrees. Some review said the fan is too weak, I think there should be a lower setting than low. It pretty powerful on low. The water tray can be removed to be cleaned, just remove the pump latch. The angled black lever. Highly recommended portable evaporative cooler.",

It also purified the air and made for a better environment for his allergies. It was easy to install and very efficient to use. In his words, it was a game changer” for his summer experience.",

    "reviewText": "Tired of super high prices for electricity these days and I live in South Louisiana where costs are pretty cheap. I wanted a stand alone AC unit for my bedroom so I don't have run the central AC for just me at night. Researched a bunch of these units and though I was skeptical of the price of this one, I took a chance. Here is my review:The GOOD: Very much like the standalone component of this AC unit. I wanted something portable that I could move around the house if the power goes out. This unit has WiFi and Alexa integration. About the only thing I have found useful about that is being able to turn it on and off with the Alexa. Outside of that, have not found any use for that integration. The unit cools very well for my bedroom which is a few hundred sq/ft. and the ambient noise is about the same as being in a hotel room and running the AC in always on mode. For me, not a problem. Additionally, I haven't really had to drain the internal condensate bucket and I run it every night. My room does not usually get more than 50% humidity so it does not produce a bunch of condensate. Even in the RV, didn't drain more than about couple of mL of water. The customer service was very good for the product too, when I needed it for the issue mentioned below.The NOT AS GOOD (but not terrible)1. Though the unit cools well for my bedroom, when I used it in a 31ft RV, along with the onboard AC in the RV, between the two of them they could only get the temp down to about 75* on a 95* day. At night it worked splendidly.2. The Alexa integration appears to be very limited. Other than turning on and off, I have not found any other useful features. Maybe I need to research further.3. After about 2 weeks of running all night every night, a new phenomenon cropped up. Once the unit gets the room down to set temperature, the compressor would cycle off as you would expect. The fan would stay running and then compressor would cycle back on as needed. Well after 2 weeks, I was awoken in the middle of the night by the silence, that you would expect when the power goes out. The unit went completely silent like it was turned off, but it was still on. Adjusting temperature kicked the unit back on and then randomly it would go silent again. After dealing with customer support for about a week and a half, it was determined that the unit is functioning as intended. The unit will turn the fans off if the room temp stays at the set level long enough. This may be ok for some but I like the ambient noise of the fans running. The issue is, you cannot set it to have a persistent fan unless you put it in \"Fan Only\" mode. I hope this is a feature that the manufacturer ends up programming into the unit. The ability to have persistent fan in AC mode.4. The expandable exhaust hose is versatile for moving the unit around but it does not contain the heat of the exhaust very well. The exhaust hose gets pretty warm and that ends up adding some heat around the unit. Its not a tremendous amount but I would expect an AC unit to contain the heat from the condenser a little better.Overall I am very happy with the unit for what I needed it for and the price. I would have thought a 10,000BTU unit would cool a little more efficiently but its fine. Also, I REALLY hope they put a persistent fan setting in the AC mode to keep the ambient noise and circulation of air going all night.",

    "reviewText": "We bought this product twice. The first time in April, 2023 and the second time in June 2023. The one we bought in June has been used in our living room and up until now, it has worked amazing. No issues. Well, unfortunately today, that all changed. If we try to use the cool setting, it will automatically turn off after 1 minute with the error code “E5” on the little display. I read through the manual and nowhere does it mention the E5 Error code. I cleaned the little filters to see if maybe that would help solve the issue but no luck. It works just fine on the fan setting but not the cooling setting. Another review (From July 2024) mentioned this error code as well. They said they had to contact customer service and after struggling to get in contact, they were told that they don’t know what it means and that they just need to replace the entire unit. I just contacted support and I’m waiting to hear back, hopefully with better news than that customer received. If I get told how to fix this or they offer to replace our unit, I’ll update my review and let y’all know. As of right now though, I’m highly disappointed. When we ordered this, we paid $340. As of right now, this is not worth $340. We’ve only had this a year.",

    "reviewText": "Live in Southeast United States where the temperature in the spring and summer ranges from 80s- 100s. Use this AC to add some additional coolness to my bedroom without cooling the entire apartment. Very easy to set up, and was able to get up and running within 15 min of delivery. Have been using every day for about a month. It is a little louder, but I typically sleep with a white noise machine and this fits right in. This is a smaller unit, so only feedback that I have is that you need to ensure that it continuously runs throughout the day if there is no secondary AC unit. Central AC went out about a week ago for a day and apartment got to the high 80s. Did not have this portable AC unit on and it took it a couple hours to fully cool my bedroom ( door closed and vents sealed while central AC was out) from high 80s to high 60s.",

It arrived two days before I could get there, and she had already managed to install and set up the unit before I got there (!). Granted, it was very hot, and she was motivated, but I was truly impressed, as this is not the sort of thing that is easy for her.Beyond that, whatever noise it makes, and regardless of other features, her apartment is 20 degrees cooler and she can sleep at night.",

    "reviewText": "I've purchased two Whynter ARC-148MS 14,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioners to help cool my NYC apartment, and I've been very happy with their performance. They are very easy to set up, with almost no work involved. They work well for a single bedroom apartment, which they cool effectively for all but the hottest and muggiest days of summer. They require little maintenance, basically rinsing off two filters once a summer and maybe checking the condensation collector drain if it's very humid out. Before shutting off the unit while cooling, I do recommend switching from cool mode to fan mode for about a minute, which I think is easier on the compressor and coils and might help the lifetime of the unit.The second unit I bought last summer stopped working after only a few uses. While the unit was still within its 1 year warranty, I was certainly dreading the issue of dealing with customer service. But I was very pleasantly surprised. Through email, I communicated with Jof Y. and he was extremely helpful in walking me through some checks and tests. We very quickly diagnosed the compressor as the problem, and he had a new unit sent immediately and free of charge! Moreover, I did not have to send the broken unit back, which was a real timesaver. What a great experience and a great relief! The replacement unit is working wonderfully over the last month.Overall, the unit itself gets 4 to 5 stars, and Jof and customer service get 6 stars!",

    "reviewText": "This is my second Whynter Portable A/C unit. I find the brand comes highly recommended and my first unit has served me well in my living room for several years. I purchased the Whynter ARC-148MS 14,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner for my home office after our record-setting heat wave in June. My home office is only 120 square feet and, by rights, I should be using a window-mounted unit, but I did not feel comfortable installing a window unit by myself in a second-story window, so I went with a portable unit. With that caveat, here are my impressions.COOLING. This Whynter works very well cooling my small space. It has a \"swing\" feature which raises and lowers the vent cover to provide an oscillating effect, which is nice.NOISE. Portable air conditioners are noisy, doesn't matter the brand or model. You are in the room with the unit, unlike a window-mounted unit where the noisy parts are outside. Because the room I am using this unit in is so small, only 120 sq ft., the noise is inescapable. If you want a quiet air conditioner, get a window-mounted unit. Running it on fan mode is a little quieter than in cooling mode, but I still feel the need to turn it off when I am on a call or online meeting.SETTING UP. Setting up the Whynter was very easy. This is a SINGLE-HOSE unit, which makes set-up a bit easier than a dual-hose unit. For performance, I actually prefer a dual-hose unit. The Whynter has casters so you can easily move it when needed. Follow the instructions, leaving your unit off for several hours after you first install it to assure best performance.PRICE. Portable A/C units tend to be more expensive than window A/C units. Given that I was unable to work in my home office this summer without A/C, the cost was worth it to me.OVERALL. I am pleased with this Whynter A/C unit. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the noise, but really, that is going to be an issue with any portable air conditioner. Whynter is my \"go-to\" brand for portable air conditioners.",

    "reviewText": "I got this air conditioner yesterday and will give my review and tests on it now, first I already own a whynter 122 model which is 7000BTU DOE and 12000 BTU ashre. it has worked wonderfully for a year now. NOW to THIS modelarc 148ms. this arrived yesterday with the bottom of the box bent up, UPS is hard as hell on products they ship, a horrible carrier. HOWEVER NO damage was done to the unit itself. installation was easier than on my previous duel hose whynter. it took me 20 minutes to get it all set up. THEN I waited 4 hours for the freon to settle before turning it on as whynter suggests. I have this in a 28 X 16.5 foot living room . NOW the tests. First it cools like crazy!, in a room at a hot 84 degrees I got a outlet temp of 58 degrees which is 26 dregees below room temp which is VERY Good!. ( air condition pros state that a good/OK air conditioner outlet temp thats 15-20 degrees below room temp is good, Less than 14 degrees and something is wrong with the AC). it cooled my room down 1 degree in just 5 minutes!. . NEXT, power draw. this AC draws the rated 11.3 amps and 1300 watts on high with the AC going full blast. fan only is 77 watts. NOTE!, if you have this hooked up to a 15 AMP circuit I reccommend no other lights or applience be hooked on the circuit. for a 20 AMP circuit you can run some lights ot a TV on the same circuit. ( NOTE: Im not an electrician or a AC repairman, these are my suggestions from personal experience). NEXXT....sound level. this unit is loud. on high it generates 62DBA at 4 feet from the unit in a live room with NO carpet or curtins. on low it generated 59DBA at 4 feet. HOWEVER at 10 feet from the unit watching TV its not too loud but I do have to turn the volume up a bit. for sleeping this noise should be great for sleeping as its a whuiute noise type noise. in a room with carpet, drapes and lots of heavy furnature or a bed it will be quieter as these thing soak up the noise.. againm my room is \"live\" and soaks up very little sound. reliability?? I dont know as Ive only had it one day, but with proper care its expected to last 7-10 years. overall this was a GREAT buy at $387 that I paid!. especially for a 14000 BTU ashrea/10300BTU DOE unit. NOTE 2!!!!: do not worry about whether an AC is one or two hose!, the ONLY thing that matters is the BTU DOE rating, the BTU ASHREA rating us useless for portable AC's.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars 12K version makes a cricket-like sound. 8K version does not.",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've had the 8K version for some time now and it's been great. It's not quiet, but it's never been annoying. I just plugged in the 12K version for a larger room and the engine has a constant chirping sound that sounds like crickets. I'm going to give it a few days to run to see if the sound peters out into something tolerable but if it keeps up I'll have to organize a return, and with a unit this large, that's going to be a real pain.Edit: If you request a return or exchange, Amazon does not offer a pick-up option. The only option is to deliver it yourself to a UPS Store, so good frickin' luck with that if you don't drive a truck. Oh, sure, you can pay UPS to come pick it up for you for an extra charge that the seller then won't reimburse you for.If the replacement unit turns out to be faulty and I have to pay UPS for two returns, I'll be reporting the seller and never buying from them again.Edit 2: The replacement unit makes the EXACT SAME metallic rattling/grinding noise that my 8000 BTU unit does not. It's so annoying that I can hear it from a completely different room. How do two different units have this exact same problem?To boot, the second unit was delivered LAYING ON ITS SIDE, which you aren't supposed to do with an AC. Nevertheless, I let it sit for more than 24 hours before testing it out. I was relieved at first when there was no grinding sound being made. Five minutes later, it won't stop. I can't tolerate it and there's no way I can sleep in a room where something is making this awful sound.",

The process of trying different things to correct the issue as well as getting them the information they needed was easy. The seller was always pleasant, courteous, and very quick in all contact we had with them. They ended up issuing us a full refund to our original payment method. Even though we weren't happy about the product stopping to function correctly, I would still recommend purchase because when it worked it worked well. Also the seller was a refreshing breeze to others I have encountered. The seller was actually top knotch and I would still feel confident in making a purchase from them.",

I've had to use the included drain to drain it out the window - and let me tell you, that plug is situated an inch off the ground. Makes it really hard to empty it, it should be situated higher!Standard issues with the single hose setup - it creates negative air pressure in the room which draws in hot air, and the cold air from the bedroom the machine uses is quite counterintuitive.However, the power usage seems to be optimal, and for that I'll give it a solid 3 stars.",

    "reviewText": "We purchased this LG 10000 BTU (cools 450 Sqft ) to help keep our master bedroom cool when our AC quit working this summer. Our bedroom is large (300 square feet) with a 14' ceiling, so we needed something capable of cooling that space. This LG definitely does the job! It is heavy, but the wheels make it easy to maneuver, setup was easy, and the directions were straightforward. This is capable of cooling our entire bedroom to the point where it is almost too cold.Upon the initial setup, it cooled our large bedroom by 5 degrees within the first 30 minutes. We wanted the bedroom around 70 degrees, and it keeps it at the temp without any issues whatsoever. I'm not sure why some reviewers mention the noise level. We keep it on the medium fan speed at night while we sleep and it is very quiet. Of course you can hear it, but as far as we're concerned, it's much quieter than we imagined it would be for a unit this size. It's expensive, but it's been really hot here in Florida in the summer. This AC really saved us when we got in a jam. We would definitely purchase this again.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great AC; but lots of erroneous answers on here from LG",
    "reviewText": "It's quiet, and I love that the hose is attached. I will update this review when I've used the unit longer, but now that I have it in home, I'm here to say to others like me who want to use a taller universal sliding glass door adapter or for any other reason know the ACTUAL hose diameter... the actual diameter of the round part of the hose (not the diffuser) is not 5\" as stated by \"Ivan\" from LG-- it's 5.9\" so it fits universal sliding door kit's for a 5.9\" hose, like this one. I just screwed it in, so take my word for it. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BXWJ9PBC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Secondly, the oval nozzle on the end of the 5.9\" hose CAN be removed (which you may want to do to use the nozzle from a universal window/door kit) - you just unscrew it! It's so frustrating when you can't get correct answers even from the manufacturer, so I thought I'd come here just to help anyone else out.UPDATE: have used this LG AC for about a week now, and it totally cools my living room (about 420 sf). It's also definitely quieter than the two other portable Acs I've owned. I had a plexi glass insert made for my very tall slider, which I recommend if the included kit is too small for your window. Love the wifi feature - have used it when not at home. Very happy. And please note that a reviewer who posted a video here erroneously states this unit has \"heat mode\" - it most definitely does not have any heat mode. He was merely turning the temperature up on the AC into the 80's, admittedly a weird thing to do, but there is no heat mode or heating element. Only Cool, Dehumidify and Fan. And Sleep (which is a lower Cool mode). Check the specs - you'll see I'm right. Really like this AC!",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Will probably leak on your floor or blow a circuit in your house",
    "reviewText": "We rarely give bad reviews, but the circumstances associated with this purchase have left us no alternative.We installed a new hardwood floor in our daughter’s bedroom and wanted to use a portable AC unit to cool the space.We bought a new LG 10000-BTU Inverter Portable Air Conditioner unit that is designed to shut itself off if there is a potential for leakage. The unit was installed in the bedroom and ran trouble free for several months. It was not moved from that location during this period of time.We then noticed water leakage on the new hardwood floor under the portable AC unit and immediately performed routine maintenance on the unit (cleaned filters and emptied the water collection tank). The leakage was substantial enough to cause permanent damage to the floor.To prevent further damage to the new floor we bought a drip tray to put under the unit and a leak detection system to let us know if it does leak.We then called LG Customer Service to determine why the portable AC unit did not shut itself off before leaking on the new wood flooring. After over 45 minutes of discussion, they agreed to schedule a service call by D.G. Appliance Service.A technician from D.G. Appliance Service arrived and discovered that the unit had a cracked water collection tank. He stated that he had performed repairs of cracked water collection tanks in the past but did not have the resources (helpers) to repair it now. He left without fixing the unit and reported that the unit had \"Physical Damage\" to his supervisor. He advised us to contact LG Customer Service to resolve the issue.We contacted LG Customer Service on the same day and were told that the warrantee did not apply since there was \"Physical Damage\" to the unit.We disputed the finding because the unit clearly had this damage upon arrival, and we reported it within the one-year warranty period.It took several months for the defect to manifest itself for several reasons:First, the LG technical support documentation is very explicit in their warnings that the unit is never to be laid on its side (or back) and should be kept in an upright position at all times - Otherwise, you risk damaging the cooling system. In order to have detected this damage upon shipment we would have had to lay the unit on its side to be able to visually inspect the water collection tank located at the bottom. This is exactly what the technician did to determine that the water collection tank was cracked. We had to help him support the unit in a horizontal position while he inspected the bottom of the unit with a flashlight.Second, for the first few months that the unit was operating the weather was fairly mild, and the unit was able to evaporate the condensation as it ran without having a buildup in the water collection tank. The heatwaves that started in mid-summer precipitated the condensation buildup in the unit's water collection system and led to the leakage through the cracked water collection tank.Since the unit was never moved from its initial installation location there was never an opportunity to damage the water collection tank except for in shipping or manufacturing.We were forced into buying an identical LG AC unit to replace the first leaky one since the permanent venting that we installed in our daughter’s bedroom made switching to a different brand difficult. Upon plugging the replacement unit into our wall socket the circuit breaker in our main panel tripped. No amount of re-setting the circuit breaker would cure the situation and we were forced to pay an electrician to trouble shoot and replace the circuit breaker. We immediately returned the replacement unit and received a third identical LG AC unit that appears to be working.We have contacted at least a dozen LG authorized and non-authorized repair centers to fix the first leaky unit but none of them will repair a portable AC unit. So we have this POS sitting in our garage waiting to get recycled…",

    "reviewText": "For some unknown reason, my office is ALWAYS hot. It doesn't matter what is, or isn't, powered on at any given time - it's always a sauna. I've gotten up to 85F in my office while the rest of the upstairs is 74-76, and it's absolutely horrible.I'm in IT, and I have a lot of computers, plus gadgets, monitors and other stuff. So I imagine it's just the heat byproduct of random stuff being on all the time, but I've been suffering this summer and finally pulled the plug on one of these \"swamp cooler\" type A/C units.It's been running nonstop since I got it, and I absolutely love it. I'm REALLY impressed at just how little water it actually uses after running for the past 8 hours almost nonstop. I put an ice pack in there which was left to freeze over night and the water is COLDDDDD. It has dropped the temperature in my 10x12 office about 10 degrees, which has made it much more tolerable to spend 8-10 hours of my day up here.We're approaching the cooler months so I expect I won't use it as much for cooling but moreso for air circulation, but I'm sure I will be very grateful to have this around next summer, and hopefully save a bit of wear & tear on my central A/C as a result! My wife is chronically cold, and I'm always hot, so maybe we'll finally find some compromise to where I can only cool the area I need around me and she can remain comfortable.The touch functions are honestly pretty intuitive, and you just keep pressing the timer to add the # of hours cumulatively - 1 touch is 1 hour, 2 is 2 hours, 3 is 3 hours, 4 is 4 hours, 5 is 5 hours (4 + 1), 6 is 6 hours (4 + 2), it's very easy to pick up. The hour markings are 1 2 4 and 8, and combining those you can get all the way up to 15 hours, as advertised.I was also really surprised that it has a moving baffle inside to move the air side-to-side, which helps with circulation. Seriously, if you are suffering in the summer or have hotspots in your house like I do, do yourself a favor and buy this!",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Fan catches on housing. Very noisy.",
    "reviewText": "When I first turned it on, the fan was very noisy and obviously catching internally. So, I spent about 30 minutes dismantling the plastic to find that the anchors for the fan motor housing are about 1-2 mm to long. (Very bad dedign.) Shaved them down with a Dremel and now it works as intended. This Chinese product has a poorly designed fan and fan housing. If you don't mind a little project, then this is perfect. I would have returned, but it took over a week to get it in the first place. I have buyers remorse, but you get what you pay for.",

    "reviewText": "Now that I've had time to try different things with it I'm pretty happy with how well it cools. The instruction book left a lot to trial and error. Remote came with a battery but did not work so I can't evaluate that. The so called \"upper tank\" appears to be a way to fill the actual lower tank. No word in the instructions about the drain plug being left open or closed in the \"upper tank\" it appeared that to fill the lower tank you pull the plug and pour the water in the top then reinsert the plug for operation. Instructions say \"ice box\" can be removed from the unit and be put in freezer. I'm guessing this means one of the blue bottles that comes with it can be frozen and put in the top to aid in cooling. The instructions say doors and windows must be left open to operate. Pretty sure that would defeat the chance of cooling my house when it's 106 degrees outside. The louvers must be pried open with a fingernail or ? and positioned. After a lot of guessing I'm pretty pleased with it now.",

The ideal solution should be a portable air con but condominium rules forbid the replacement of the window frames nor the sticking out of the exhaust chute from such a unit. This cooler is the next best choice. Whilst not as effective as an air conditioner, I measure the temperature dropping about 5°C when unit is running.However, it requires daily maintenance like emptying and filling of the water tank and the replacement of the ice packs every 3 hours. And these should be the bigger ones used in food coolers and not the toy like tubes that comes with it. If you are lazy and does not want to spend extra on some \"real\" cooler packs, this may not be for you.",

Since I had two I pulled one out and let it acclimate for a week or two before use, No odor at all. The second one I pulled out and let it sit for a few hours it had a small faint odor that was present first use but than was gone. We will see how it goes next season when I pull these back out. I suspect that the bad oder are from rancid water not able to escape the machine. I can't say yet.",

We have one in the bedroom and one in the bathroom and we keep the bathroom door open we also keep the ceiling fans throughout the house on high so they circulate that cool layer that comes down the hall and into the rest of the house during the night so the house remains cool at night and we can sleep well. I would recommend these to anyone who wanted to give this a try versus in window air conditioning. These have worked so well we have decided to get portable bigger units for other parts of the house rather than spending a fortune on air conditioning. Highly recommend them.",

    "reviewText": "Got us through the summer and made us more comfortable. The AC is in the living room and doesn't reach fully in the bedroom. This little boost bumps up the cool in the bedroom and really helped. Sometimes didn't even need the AC. Sprayed a little scent in the water. Lovely.Update: lasted a couple of years. Replaced it with a new one, but the new one seems to make a screaming sound. Sometimes the screaming sound stops so I'm going to give it a chance to mellow out. But in general this is better unit than the other ones that give you very little mist at all more like an atomizer and require you to use the fan along with the mist. This unit is a proper mist and you don't need to use the fan with it.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works Great In Texas Heat",
    "reviewText": "What a GREAT addition to my workshop here in the Texas Hill Country. I have a 30'x40' spray foam insulated workshop, no A/C and have been going thru one of the hottest summers yet. My neighbor bought the smaller unit for his backyard porch and it wasn't bad, but just too small for my shop so I went for the largest one they had and I was NOT disappointed.Pros:This swamp cooler is big standing at 5'0\" tall with the standard wheels it comes with, 43\" wide and 24\" deep. This unit has three controls, one for the water pump, fan speed (low, Med, High) and a control for the Vertical Oscillating Vanes that go back and forth from left to right.What you don't see and not listed in the manual is that it has two sets of Horizontal Vanes that you can adjust independently to blow air up and the second set of Vanes to blow up or down as well, so in my case, I can have one set of vanes blowing air up at my head so to speak and another set of vanes blowing air at my stomach so to speak. You have to be very careful trying to adjust these, because they are hard to adjust and they are plastic, so if you push too hard, you may break them, but once you get them in the position you want, it works great.Fan Speeds, Honestly, I only use the low speed and its enough to keep me comfortable while working. It can be 104 degrees outside and I am comfortable working in my shop for hours and only on the low speed, but I keep it pointed at me. My work area from the fan is about 15-25' and its comfortable enough once it gets going. Since my shop is rectangular in shape, and has a large area, so I turn on my attic fan to suck out the hot air and let the cool air from the fan circulate around the bottom area and it works out great. You can see by the picture that I lower my door just enough to allow it to get the air it needs to work and keep one back door slightly open to create the airflow it requires.The unit holds a lot of water, but you will go thru a lot of water during a hot summer day, so it has a little door in the front that you can add water with a hose or bucket and it the back it has a hose connection with a floater (like a toilet tank) that you set the hose on a low setting and it keeps the fan water level at what it needs.Putting together wasn't hard, you might need an extra set of hands to flip it over to put the wheels on and then use something to help prop up the unit once you have all the wheels on, so you don't put to much pressure on the wheels when you try to stand it up.Cons:The water matts are made of corrugated paper and when you first get it and start it up it stinks like a wet dog for a long time but its the paper getting wet, but once you use it a few times, the smell goes away.The weep holes on the top of the water matts are okay the closer they are to the pump, but the weep holes furthest away from the pump don't get water and they matt stays dry. I opened the unit and took the matts out and stuck a screw driver in the holes to see if something was blocking up the holes, but there was nothing there so I think the pump is not strong enough to push the water all the way over to the furthest points. Now, with this said, I put a level on my unit and it was perfectly level, so it wasn't that the unit was off balance, again, either this is left over plastic blocking the holes or the pump is just not strong enough to flood the area with enough water.Final evaluation - Regardless of the Con I listed, I would recommend and re-purchase this unit if I had too, it has really made my life in my workshop workable. I weld, and do repair on other things and I can do this comfortably now, even in this 104 degree weather. Is it A/C, NO, Not at all, but it brings the temp down so much and over about an hour of use, the whole shop is cooler and much more tolerable. Note: you will go thru water, so you will at some point have to refill or just connect a hose at a trickle and let it keep the unit full for you.I hope this helps out. Keep COOL my Friends!",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Worked great for 2 years",
    "reviewText": "Cools very well with awesome air flow! You can feel it from up to 25 feet away when on high. Worked great here in the central valley of California up till the temps go over 102°, then efficiency drops considerably. But it's an evaporative cooler and they all do at those temps. This unit is very light and easy to move around on hard dirt if empty of water, and if full of water on concrete. It is not loud if on low, but on high you have to raise your voice if you are within 10 feet of it. My only real gripe is the motor rusted after only one cooling season and now is locked up after only 2 cooling seasons. If the additional 4 year warranty covers the motor then it would be well worth the extra money because the replacement motor costs more than the warranty does. Did not expect this to rust so fast being a motor supposedly designed for a damp environment, I expected the metal to be more rust resistant and was surprised that it was an open housing motor (you can see the windings) and not sealed. It is obviously not a motor designed for wet / damp environment. My other recommendation is to take a drill bit the same size as the original holes where the water drips from the top channel onto the pads and redrill / ream them out then blow out with compressed air. The manufacturing process of drilling out these holes seems to leave lots of plastic remnants which slow down or block entirely the steady stream of water. Removal of the top cover during this process will ensure that all plastic shavings are removed and can not continue to clog the holes. Other than that, it worked great, while it worked. Overall, I think it is overpriced for the quality. One could purchase a residential side draft swamp cooler for 800 dollars and with a few modifications (garden hose connection for water fill valve, caster wheels), would have a better quality product that's going to last much longer, albeit much heavier and not as portable!",

The wheels under it are less than adequate as they are poorly made and, when full with water it cannot be moved easily. I sent this information to the mfg. and they sent a new set of wheels, however, it's been weeks and they still have not arrived????????? The small door in the front of the unit where the unit can be filled with a bucket or pail falls off and lands inside the water storage below. I have had to fish it out 2 times and I never use this door as I use a water hose connection provided to feed the float system that works well. it will fall off If you just touch it. What a shame that these petty little issues take away from the excellent produce that it truly is. I purchased it to cool the areas where I work and it does an exceptional job.",

    "reviewText": "Finally I can work in my garage on hot days!I need to do some DIY works in my garages and it doesn’t have an HVAC system. Usually I just let the garage door open and use several fans. But it was a little hotter than expected last week so I needed some additional cooling so I wouldn't be in a puddle of sweat. I want a portable ac because it can be moved to a general area of need. So I chose this at a reasonable price.The product arrived quickly and was easy to remove from the packaging. Compact and won’t take too much space. It came with all of the necessary elements to vent the heat out. I made some minor adaptations to the garage door and it worked perfectly. I tried Cooling mode and it didn’t come out with cool air at first. Just when I thought it was damaged, I heard a noise of hum and I knew it was at that moment the compressor starting to work. Then the cool air came. Very strong and cool air actually. After the compressing was running normally, I used an infrared thermometer to test the temperature of the air vent and it was 43℉. As I chose the turbo function (the button next to the ON/OFF on the remote), it was loud because the fan was running on the highest level. I used my phone to test the sound level and it was 56.7dB. Not quiet but acceptable. One more thing to notice is that you need to fasten the drain cap tightly, otherwise there will be a leakage after running for two hours.I will keep trying and updating if there is anything wrong with this machine. So far so good.",

    "reviewText": "Update 2; received a replacement unit and this one is working fine. I suspect the original unit was damaged during shipping. The new unit is quieter than the original and the noise level now is ok; louder than a fan of course but it's not so loud you can't sleep with it on. Overall works fine now. When buying one of these I would suggest you make sure to test it out right away and run it a few times to make sure it wasn't damaged during shipping.Update: after speaking with the seller the offered to send a replacement. Will update this after I receive the new unitAbsolute piece of junk junk. Only actually ran for somewhere around 12-15 hours,. The cooling output was alright, but the noise level was absurd. And then things got bad. At this point it started making an extremely loud whistling sound - picture the most annoying teapot imaginable. This was multiple times louder than than just the standard running noise, which was too loud to begin with. Even after turning it off the whistling continued for another 30 to 45 minutes and could be heard two rooms away. After that the compressor stopped working, which mean no more cooling. So now it's a $300 fan, and not even a good one at that. Don't waste your time or money on this.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Doesn’t Cool",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This was bought to cool a space of about 550 square feet during the summer heat in Kansas. We got it and did a temporary install to try it out before officially putting a hole in the wall for the exhaust.The Set Up: the set up is pretty self-explanatory. When you take a look at the quick start guide that they provide. However, the drain tube was a little bit more complicated seeing as there are two drain ports, and only one drain tube provided. We initially installed the drain tube on the bottom port thinking that’s where it was supposed to go and eventually switched it to the middle port after we opened it up and realized there was water in the middle port. The instructions do not specify, if once installed in the middle port the bottom port needs to stay open or we need to get another hose. It just kind of doesn’t talk about it.The Unit: In the video we’ve had it on for about 45 minutes and the room is still quite hot. All windows and doors are closed there’s no air leaks anywhere. The unit itself is noisy but I’d be willing to overlook this if it actually cooled. There are brief moments when it will shoot out very cold air and then all of a sudden it’s like the fan is the only thing running. You can even hear a change in the way it sounds when the compressor is working and when it’s only the fan. Honestly based on reviews I expected the unit to cool quickly or at least cool the space instead of circulating the air.The Remote: five of the buttons on the remote are not available for the model that I purchased. The guide says to push turbo button to turn on a faster mode, more powerful mode and honestly it does not make a difference.Overall for the price and the unit as it’s advertised, I would not recommend it does not cool, which is literally the reason that it was purchased it’s been running now for about an hour as I’m finishing this review and the room has yet to even begin cooling down at all. Essentially we just purchased a very expensive fan. Will be returning this product.",

    "reviewText": "Update: This is a very poorly designed AC model. I have had the unit for a month now and I wish I had of bought a window unit. So not only is it noisier then my last window AC unit, there is this knocking sound that sounds like something it loose. I tried to use to the remote a week later and it wouldn't work. I tried to turn it on and off and a bunch of other functions. Nadda. I emailed the manufacturer about the remote and let them know and they said only a few options actually work on the remote control... Not sure why they would have buttons on the remote if they don't do anything...The biggest issues I have found with the unit it the water. It comes with a hose that could be put out the windows if its close enough to it. I had to use a bucket as the hose was too short. But the hose is at the top of the water collection so it essentially dose nothing. A few drops came out. The unit shut off and said that it was full of water but the drain plug is all the way at the bottom of the unit.... No removable container. No room to get anything under it to drain it. You either have to be super strong to be able to life it into the tub or roll it outside to drain the water out.... Its very hard to move around with the extra weight of the water even though its on wheels... I wish I had of done more research before buying this unit.It is noisier then my old window unit. The window kit does not fit any of my windows so I to improvise and use some tape. All the window kits pieces were the same size. Should come with a couple smaller pieces to be able to fit all window sizes. Its actually only 5000BTU not 8000BTU. It throws out a lot of heat from the back which is where the air intake is. It does cool but I wish I had of gotten a 5000BTU window AC unit for a fraction of the cost. Not worth the $400 in my opinion.",

    "reviewText": "I love LG. I think they don't put out a product unless it is one of the best in its field, and that's why I decided to trust them again when I needed an indoor air conditioner. The reviews of various companies all had good reviews, as this did, and it is otherwise hard to choose - so I just chose LG and I'm happy, so far, that I did.I wanted an indoor unit specifically. My concerns with that type of unit were 1) do I have to empty water buildup, 2) efficiency or cooling ability 3) power consumption, specifically, will the cord get hot when on continuously for days...So all three concerns are satisfied, cord/wall stays cool as does the unit, no water buildup or emptying (on cooling mode) to worry about at all, and unit pumps wonderfully freezing air into the room - quickly cooling a 400 ft space, and even supplying cool dry air to a larger space. I am sufficiently impressed. If it never breaks and is always the same trusty unit that it is now, I would consider it perfect.The cons? Well, it is certainly louder than my old energy star window unit. I don't mind white noise at all though for sleeping, and it is not too loud for that. I would like a lower fan speed option, that is quieter, but I doubt other models are any quieter. I believe I read the fan has to run to wick the water buildup away - so a low setting simply might not be possible with an indoor unit of any kind. In any case, it does have a low and high speed.Suggestion: the remote could use an led display light. You pick it up in the night to turn the fan to low, or turn it off - and you can't see squat, start guessing, and hitting all the wrong buttons. So, I just had to learn where each button is, no big deal, but light would be improvement.Overall, it has reliably and impressively cooled my space, sealed off my window perfectly, jumps to life every time I ask it to, and worked perfectly as advertised. Would definitely recommend.Update after two seasons: still going strong, still cooling beautifully. HOWEVER, unbelievably the unit leaked spots on my carpeted floor, partly ruining that section of carpet and leaving a strange rusty stain. I place a baking sheet under the unit to catch the water, and that has been working through season two. This year, there was only a few drips in the pan which evaporated before they had to be sponged. I guess the previous year was particlularly humid, and it needed sponging every few days. Still, the unit was kept on flat out lowest setting for months and did not fail.When I called LG about the leak, I stated the manual says it is supposed to turn itself off when reservoir is full (so it doesn't destroy your carpet right??!!! ) and we wen't round and round in misunderstanding in what seemed to be different languages. I was directly to a website - unbelievably - which demonstrated how to plug a hose (not supplied) into the unit which leads to a drainhole - yeah!!! As if I live in a warehouse with one of those in the bedroom floor! Un. Believable.That said, it is still working great, on it's cake pan, cools perfectly, none of the other 1 star issues I've read about thankfully, and I found an added bonus to indoor units in general: doesn't matter if its 45 degrees outside. If the sun has heated the upstairs all day and you want a blast of cool, you can just blast it on and cool everything down. You can't do that with a window, or central unit as you can't run it below 60 or so, or risk damaging it (and a window compressor with sensor won't even turn on). But this one you can, great stuff. Also, I compared it to central HVAC electric usage, and it seemed to be about even, or even less, so it wasn't out of control in that regard, though it doesn't waste energy heating rooms you don't need.",

    "reviewText": "Our blower just up and quit on the hottest week on record. Our AC repair company didn't think to overnight the part and we didn't think to ask either (until we were suffering). Lesson learned, get it overnight. We had bought this \"just in case\" several months ago. We set it up. Honestly underpowered but a lifesaver while the outdoors was literally 99 degrees!It took a whole week to get the part. So around day 2 we went out and found a second one locally that was even more powerful. We plugged that in on a different circuit. Same room. Total of about 17K BTU cooled a very large living room with two offices ( three laptops), working from home, down to about 71-79 degrees. Compared to the alternative, the rest of the house was around 88-95 and humid, it was an improvement.Be realistic about what you're getting. There's going to be a heat wave that nothing will fix. But this is still better than no AC. When the AC went back on, it took 8 hours for it to get back to normal. Meanwhile we ran one of the little ACs in the living room to keep cool. We had a bad situation. Our living room is huge, it's very open with doorways we had to cover over and doors we had to keep closed. We were constantly getting a hot breeze over the top of the curtain we hung over a hallway. It was the best we could do. Computer situation made it impossible to use another room.Setup was so easy compared to wrestling a heavy air conditioner into a window, then arranging it so it's angled right, using bits of wood and cardboard, taping it all around, to keep out bugs... etc. Never again.We have two of these and they're awesome. We're going to use one in the kitchen when cooking in the summer heat. No more sweating in the kitchen.",

    "reviewText": "So 3 months into owning this unit it’s finally hot enough outside to set it up. IT WORKS! Good thing since I’m out of my return window.Background: Moved into my first home with Central Air, works great downstairs, not so good upstairs. We lack a return up here, it is a retrofit gravity system. I needed a solution to not melt myself and my wife in a relatively small room with 2 robust gaming PCs and too many monitors.Pros:Air out the top is nice and coldRemote is easy to useSetup was about 10 minutesFan blows strong and the cooling vent has a nice oscillationCons:Pretty darn loud (All portable AC’s are since the compressor is inside the room)Exhaust tube is Very Hot, which is to be expected if you have any idea how an ac works.After about 30 minutes the computer room (upstairs, old house, 11x15’, newer windows) is still pretty warm, but it is getting better.(1 hr- still not Cold, yet better. Although there is no gaming going on so that will be the true test. I will update if this LG fails that test)Hindsight being 20/20, just shoving a window ac in would have definitely cooled the space faster and not introduced extra heat into the room (exhaust tube), while also being a bit quieter.BUT - Being relatively portable and not having to screw anything into my window/frame is very convenient. I can see myself keeping this unit and not giving it away like I have 7-8 window ac units before. Also hindsight, should have kept one…Tip: Keep the vent as short and straight as possible.Unit has a dehumidifier mode, you Must attach a hose to the upper drain.No hose/drain required dying AC mode, the unit has an evap system. It will however warn you if you need to drain it.I’d call it a safe buy, reputable brand, fair price per BTU. I think I’ll get some kind of insulation for the vent.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased this portable air conditioner for an enclosed porch with casement windows. I could not use a window unit because it would not fit. The unit came with a window mount for the exhaust which can be mounted vertically or horizontally. The included window exhaust kit was too short for my windows so I ordered a longer one from Amazon. The unit has been in operation for several days now and is quiet and efficient. It can be controlled by an app on your phone or by a remote. It cools well and is keeping the room at a balanced temperature despite large sunny windows on 3 sides of the room. I would recommend this unit.Update: The portable air conditioner developed a problem with an error code related to drainage after 1 month of service. The manufacturer's service representative was very responsive and tried to fix the problem. When the problem reoccurred they shipped me an entirely new air conditioner to replace the malfunctioning unit. Great service and great warranty. I would highly recommend them.",

    "reviewText": "This unit was easy to set up. It only took about 10 minutes to put the few parts together and it was quickly cooling everything down. Likes: We only have used the AC and Fan options and these both worked well. The room where we set this up was noticeably cooler in less than 30 minutes. The noise was fine for us since we usually need white noise to sleep. Dislikes: It is a bit heavier and more awkward than I anticipated based on other reviews we read. Having 2 people to get it out of the box and into location makes it much easier especially since you can't tip it. We really needed the cord to be about 2 feet longer. We also had better luck using the remote than the buttons on the machine. It seemed like there was a big delay. We also wish there was an option to keep the fan running even after the AC has stopped. Our sleep was very interrupted the first night with the machine going and then quiet when it had reached the proper temperature. Overall though we are very happy and are glad we made the purchase.",

Note: The cause of the clicking is explained in the user manual... The unit does heat and cool well... and does not click in cool mode.",

It gets extremely hot in AZ where 100 - 117 degrees is common during the summer. I used ICE and the frozen blocks with the water but it blows cold for only a short time and then it blow warm air when its set for cool air. The fan also is not very strong as you can barely feel the breeze when you are sitting only 4-6 feet away, so a very weak fan.I will be returning this product back and hopefully get a full refund.",

BUT don’t expect to get cool like a HVAC can if your need to cool a space (semi insulated) during a heatwave. What I find that works for me is using gallon of water from fridge to pour into bucket and cycle several ice bricks (2 at a time) every couple of hours to get small space to a consistent, tolerable temperature if you’re gonna be in the space for several hours.",

It's not an eyesore or difficult to operate. It has a convenient feature in which it beeps to let you know that the water level is too low to use with the cool feature.",

    "reviewText": "I am a retired 71-year-old, managing several properties in an active adult community in Arizona. I had one of two AC units in a house die. I need it replaced. Unfortunately, after calling several AC installers, I was given a three-to-four-week delay for installation. My tenant's senior citizens can't live without AC in Arizona.So, I went online to find something that could bridge the gap and not break the bank. After several hours of shopping online and comparing lots of options, I purchased the 3531 CFM Evaporative Air Cooler, Mountman Portable Swamp Cooler, 10.6-Gal Tank, 120° Oscillation, 41\" Water Cooler Fan for Indoor and Outdoor Patio, Porch, Yard.I purchased the unit because of the size of the tank, the fact that it doesn't need the window venting, making it easy to move room to room, the price is extremely competitive and the fact that Mountman provides a three-year warranty compared to other sellers with a one-year warranty.PLEASE READ ABOVE ALL THE SELLER'S DISCRIPTION OF THE QUALITIES OF THIS PORTABLE AC UNIT!!!!It has only been a few days, but my tenants are more than satisfied. This unit will enable them to stay cool. On the positive side, the house has two AC units and the one that covers the main house is still running. The unit that needs to be replaced covers the bedrooms. The new portable AC is in their bedroom, so other than adding water once or twice a day, everything is good.I am going to order at least one more so there will be no delay if any tenant loses an AC unit. Great inexpensive bridge unit the new unit is installed. Great investment even if you don't manage houses; I plan to use it in an Arizona room and the master bedroom so I can turn off the air to the AC unit cooling two other bedrooms. GREAT INVESTMENT!",

However, this company stands by their product because they immediately let me know that my order must have been missing this piece and immediately shipped it to me.Despite this, the swamp cooler works great, and it gets a two thumbs up from my wife, who prior to the arrival of the cooler, refused to sit on the patio when temps went into the 90’s. Operating on high, (which is very very quiet) temperatures in the low 90’s (93 to be exact) dropped to a very comfortable 84 in Central Texas Hill Country heat. The oscillating fan cools the entire 22’ x15’ patio, and evenings outdoors are now quite enjoyable. The ice packs add to the cooling effect. Definitely would buy this one again.",

    "reviewText": "It’s very portable due to the light weight when empty, the pump and design works nice, however after a year of use, the medium and low fan stopped working. I’ve always left it on high but the medium nor low work now. Since idk when but it just shuts off the fan. But the high has a nice breeze to it. Overall worth it for my use. UPDATE: Now the high setting no longer works so therefore the entire thing is useless now. Lasted a little over a year but not worth it.",

    "reviewText": "I really love the design of this product, especially the casters which make it easy to move, the ability to run the fan with or without cooling and/or oscillation, the controls which are well-designed and easy (and even fun) to use, the handy drain plug and (last but not least) no less than three different options for filling the unit with water! You can pour water into the tank via the door provided on the front of the unit. Or you can fill the tank by attaching your garden hose directly to the unit via the connector provided on the side. This option features auto-shutoff via float switch functionality to prevent overfilling of the tank. As such, this presumably also means that you could keep your hose continuously connected to the unit to automatically top off the tank as the water evaporates (but I’m not sure I’d recommend that, especially when the unit is unattended). Finally you can add water directly into the water distribution tray located on the the top of the unit via a large door. In the water distribution tray you’ll also find slots to insert (optionally if desired) the three medium-sized ice packs that come included with the unit. And if you really want to go crazy, there is enough extra room (even with the ice packs installed) to dump a full bag of ice in there as well! Here I should mention that I don’t really know if you’re supposed to be putting ice in there or not, so proceed with caution. What I do know is that with 3 frozen ice packs in there along with another 6 lbs of ice dumped on top of them (for the next half hour or so at least) it’s somehow suddenly September in Texas…THREE MONTHS EARLY!",

This product is, without a doubt, the worst of the worst in terms of misrepresented products sold on Amazon.I purchased a 10,000 BTU 450 sq ft unit, but the unit I received is only 6000 BTU and does not cover 450 sqft or even the 350 sqft it says on the box. The part number listed on the unit says 150 to 300 sq ft max coverage. On other listingd. This product has three different part numbers and three different listed manufacturers associated and included with the unit. information, including Acekool, Creative Inovations Inc, CFI, and a myriad of incorrect and unverifiable information.The unit also short cycles off and on every 3 to 5 minutes, and the user manual is filled with discrepancies and typos. This is clearly a very poor sub-standard Chinese knockoff. I found 24 different manufacturers online that use this same part number. This is obviously whiteboxed by a company and sold to anyone wanting to buy a few and slap their branding on them.I am extremely disappointed with this product and will be returning it immediately.",

    "reviewText": "This thing is ineffective. The exhaust air that flows through the exit duct heats up behind the unit, competing with the cool air in front. So, the temperature in my 150-square-foot room never drops below 80 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. Humidity is still over 69% throughout the day.Furthermore, we will always be concerned about the water overflowing and window adapter detaching from the window when the unit is moved slightly. The window adapter is useless and had to use duct tape to keep it from falling down. The widow adapter also does not keep heat out and will leak with the heat coming from the air duct.This device also takes up a lot of space with a bucket for collecting the water. Instead, I bought an AC window unit from LG, which is much more efficient and takes up no space; the entire room is cooled below 60 degrees Fahrenheit in less than two hours. Never again I will purchase a portable air conditioner.",

It's super light and easy to carry around, which is perfect for me since I sometimes need it in my office and sometimes outside when I'm chilling in my backyard.It cools down super fast. I mean, in just about an hour, it can take a room from pretty warm to comfortably cool. The size is perfect—not too bulky, and it fits nicely wherever I put it.What I really like is how it's not just for the house. I've taken it camping, and it was a lifesaver. It’s pretty quiet, too, especially on the sleep setting, so it doesn’t keep me up at night.The remote control is handy, letting me switch between modes without getting up. And I can point the air just where I want with the adjustable vent.All in all, it's a great little air conditioner that does exactly what I need it to do. Totally recommend it if you're looking for something that's easy to move around and does the job!",

The cab of my truck is about 50 square feet, and this is just ok to be put on the passenger seat. It only needs a small space, with low noise in the sleep mode. Left it for 30min out of the box as instructed via. This air conditioner easily operation and low on power usage. Just make sure that both hot air exhaust hose and drain pipe are directed out a window. It has a touch screen, so I can use it without reading the user manual. Also, it has such a great cooling effect that I have to tuck myself in after turning it on for only 10mins. The only drawback is that I need to fix the outlet on the window with a cardboard. That will be better if the seller can provide a cover that well fits the car window. This air conditioner is a great partner on the highway. I will recommend it to my truck driver friends.",

In a hot room, you need to be in front of the unit to feel the cool air. It's a good spot cooler, and that's about it.I may buy another one of these for power outages, short camping trips. But mainly, it's used at home for spot cooling in a hot room.I let it run for a few hours on full blast. It burned a stead 193 watts. Not bad for emergency/spot cooling. Just know what to expect. Not a strong fan, so you have to be close. It's only half the cooling capacity of the smallest window units.In a computer room, it's great when the PC starts heating up.Try it out! Expensive though.",

    "reviewText": "I have a pc gaming rig that generates enough heat to become its own space heater (Any gamer can relate) and I really didn't feel like running my house AC to dissipate the heat. The other portable AC's you can get online (The ones you roll around) are pretty bulky. And being that my breaker is only 15 amps. That combined with my rig would occasionally trip the breaker, and especially on really hot days which is bad lol. I live in an area that's warm all year round so opening the window just doesn't cut it. I am fully aware that this thing was built for camping or for cars in mind. But it also does a pretty decent job of dissipating heat from say a gaming pc in a small room. It wont get the room ice cold like one of the big AC's. But itll keep it cool enough to keep you from sweating. Love it, just kinda wish it wasn't so pricey at the end of the day, but I understand these things are somewhat of a niche market. I recommend it!",

That is to say it is affordable and does make a difference. I live in QLD Australia and the humidity is a real problem. An 'evaporative cooler' is not an effective air cooler in humid conditions. This unit is an 'Air Conditioner' and does cool the air and remove humidity. I was impressed with the amount of water it removed from the air. I use it in a slide on (truck) camper. A small space and it works. This thing is not small but is comparable with the other units on the market and is lighter which is an important consideration weight is critical. this is the pick of the market at this price.",

I experienced what I thought was an incomplete assembled cooler, but after speaking with the principal/owner, it was apparent they made significant improvements to the unit to allow ice to be used in the water, which cools the air about 30 degrees more than normal. Their fan motors are of superior quality, sealed units. I live in Phoenix, AZ where summer temps are record breaking at 118 degrees, we use our Cajun Kooler coupled with our mister system so we can enjoy being outside on the patio. This unit is superior to others we've tried, and I highly recommend it.",

Worse, it cycles on and off so that you can't even try to get used to it!It was so loud when I tried to sleep with it on that my wife and I turned it off. This unit is in the bedroom. You can hear the loud moaning with the bathroom door shut. You can hear it all the way out in the kitchen.If you can't sleep with it, you can't keep it. We have already Been through a lot returning the first one I will run this for a day or two to see if we can get used to it before our ears give out, or if it quiets down.Super disappointed so far. GE used to be a name that meant something. Apparently not today. Newer technology should mean a new one would be much quieter than ones I have owned in the past. Nope!UPDATE:I returned it, and bought a much less expensive and much quiter Black and Decker 14,000 btu model. Satisfied so far, still waiting for my close to 700 dollar refund from Amazon for the horrible GE branded a/c.",

    "reviewText": "My only dislike is the exhaust system. The hose fitting is loose on the section it attaches to the back of the air conditioner. Moving the air conditioner will sometimes make it come un-attached. I mainly use the cold air so the heat it produces needs to go out of the window. The exhaust hose adjusts in length but the insulated cover that wraps around the hose is not long enough for the hose. Since the exhaust hose is exposed and very warm, some of the heat is introduced back into the room I want to cool. Wish more exhaust insulation covers were available. Maybe smaller section covers included as an extention if needed.Instructions showed it can fit a smaller window such as a 20 inch but you have to cut the window adapter to the correct size. When the two pieces of window adapter plates overlap the exhaust port hole is covered. I had to cut out the section that covers the exhaust port hole.Other than that the machine sets as cold at 64 degrees Fahrenheit, quiet, and blows fairly strong. Would buy again if I must.",

    "reviewText": "It took a long time for this to ship, the box was beat up when it arrived but the contents seemed ok. While waiting for it to ship I purchased and used the 10,000 BTU version of this air conditioner from another store (it’s ultimate destination to a bedroom). The 10,000 version was easy to put together (once I figured out the top of the box lifts off the packaging after you cut the straps) and worked well cooling the area. The 14,000 version is a bit bigger, was difficult to wrangle the hose (kept unlocking and detaching one side or another and popping out of the brackets all together). And really was disappointing as it works nowhere near as well as the 10,000 did in the same area. I had high hopes, more power would equate to better cooling. I’ll keep using it to see if it gets any better and update if it does (especially since it would be hard to wrangle, repackage and return). This was definitely a case of more power being no better. Also I do agree the dry mode tends to feel cooler than the actual AC mode and is better at cooling a larger area.",

It did what was intended and I highly recommend it for apartments or a large room!",

    "reviewText": "This unit is by far the best I have ever owned.Compared to others it is super quiet especially when running it on low speed.Everything came as new as it possibly could be, nothing was missing.Will cool rooms/areas much bigger than its recommendation of 550sqft easily on high speed.You will use less power as it gets the job done much much faster than a cheaper unit and just goes into rest mode, compared to others having to run all day long.If you are thinking of getting a portable AC spend the extra $100-$150 and grab this one, don't risk it on a lower or higher priced unit it will guaranteed be extremely loud trust me bought and returned a few other brands over this summer all of them were 1.5x louder at the very least.But this one is a true gem, 100% recommend! Well done GE!",

    "reviewText": "Setting up is pretty easy, although the instructions have a lot to be desired with spelling errors. Turn the unit on to make sure, then turn off to lug it to a suitable place. Heavy unit with wheels.1) Find a suitable window first and set up the opening using the provided tool.2) Screw the hose onto the window end,3) Screw the AC end into the hose.4) Connect the AC end to the back of the AC.5) Plug the unit in and it works with all the commands.The hose and the window end get VERY hot.Foam was used to cover the window covering along with bubble wrap and foam wrapped around the hose leading up to the AC unit. It is one ugly set-up for now until certainty can be reached about this unit quality.They do sell portable AC exhaust protection insulation sleeves for about $12-$13 each. The length of such sleeve runs about 59 inches, so one must know how far one will pull the unit from the window opening to fit the sleeve.So far so good, extra insurance was purchased to be on the safe side. Unit to be run one month to make sure that it's working to meet Amazon return deadline in case of failure. Further comments will be entered at a later time.",

Being able to boost the cooling power with ice and cool water has been nice to have when it has been extra hot. I hardly use the portable AC we have now that this has arrived. It works much better at keeping the room temperature bearable.",

    "reviewText": "This is a cheaply made unit but it works okay for what it is.Before my actual review, I wanted to mention the ice packs because a lot of reviews complain about them. Yes, the ice packs melt quickly. You'll need to keep a few and rotate them through the freezer if you want consistent ice packs. This is not a product flaw. It's just physics. Putting something frozen in water- a heat sink- makes it melt faster than when just on a surface.Now for my actual product feedback.The air that comes out of it, even without ice packs, is definitely cooler than the air that comes out of an ordinary fan.It isn't strong enough to really significantly cool a space, but for a very small space or for the area immediately in front of it, it works reasonably well. It will be much more effective in an arid climate than in a humid one. To counteract this in the humid area I live in, I simultaneously run a dehumidifier.I had it for about 2 days with it working quite well with constant use. Partway through the third day, it started to leak pretty badly. I opened it up and tightened all the internal screws I could reach, then closed it again. Unfortunately, the leak continues. I will be returning this and trying a different model that is hopefully made better.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Chill Out: Effective and Energy-Saving Cooler",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So, this is a cooler that works on the water-air cooling effect. Assembly is super simple—you just need to screw on its wheels, which is optional if you want the cooler to be static.Note, it should be placed where it can grab fresh air, preferably with its back near an open window. When you enable the cool button, it uses a water pump to bring water from its tank to the top, where it can be slightly cooled with an ice pack and then goes to a paper-ish filter, which cools the incoming air.Without the water cooling effect, it just produces airflow in the room (probably could lower the temperature by 1-2 degrees and create a pleasant breeze). With water, it decreases the temperature by up to 4-5 degrees, and the airflow is much cooler and more pleasant.I tried it for several hot days recently and liked how it works. My office is part of the living area near the entrance and on the sunny side, so cooling it helps me work better.Two ice packs are not enough, but the good thing is that you can use other brands for ice packs (as shown in the photo).Overall, I can recommend this cooler. It creates a good cooling effect without consuming a lot of electricity.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If you're looking for an affordable cooling solution as an alternative to regular air conditioning which costs a lot in monthly electricity consumption, this evaporative air cooler may be the solution you're looking for.Setup is pretty easy. It came with 4 wheels, 2 of them have locks. You just need to install the wheels at the bottom of the unit and you're done.Operations is straight forward. It has the basic Spin, Timer, Speed and Power buttons.The Cool function is why you're getting this as your summer cooling machine. You fill up the tank with water through the top panel and there are 3 intake holes. Instruction is not detailed enough but I assume you place the 2 ice packs on top so the water you pour will be cold once it reaches the bottom tank.It has a considerable size so make sure it fits your space. Just using the fan function is really enough for California weather actually as it's quite strong already but for areas that's extremely hot, the cool function is a must have.",

    "reviewText": "Perfect Evaporative Air Cooler Did a lot of research before purchasing an evaporative cooler and was very happy I chose the Landeagle brand. First of all the evaporative cooler has a maximum air volume of up to 3,288 CFM. and a max wind Range of 800 Sq.ft. Not only can it be used in the living room. It can also be placed on the patio, so you can cool down and enjoy the food and scenery with your family, and the top can hold wine glasses and so on, which is nice! Humanized design with 360° universal wheels, remote control, and touch control, which is easy to move and use. Add ice boxes and ice water to make the wind feel cooler. It can also be timed for 1-12 hours. Convenient for setting the time for evening use. What I love most about this swamp cooler is that it has a safety feature that automatically switches the pump off (the fan stays on) when the water level is low. The extra-large water tank and two water refill settings are also nice for families with elderly and pregnant women. And the fan blade design is friendly for families with kids and pets.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this for our tiny desert vacation home. It is a basic evaporative cooler that cools hot air by having it flow through pads that are wet with water. I fill it only with water purchased from the store because of the large calcium deposits present in the well-water in the area. It has made our small, two-room cottage very bearable, even during the hottest afternoon. It is not \"refrigerated\" like an air conditioner, but it has an area to introduce ice if you want even cooler air. The most important thing is that it's on wheels, so we can push it to wherever we need to use it. While preparing meals, we can put it in the kitchen. During the rest of the time, we keep it in the living area. Beware, however, as evaporative coolers do not work in wet climates. Only buy if you live in an area with very low humidity or it will not work.",

    "reviewText": "My office where I work has very poor airflow, is always very warm, and the humidity can get as low as 20%. I needed a solution to enable me to work comfortably all day. I did some research on evaporative coolers and settle on this one, mainly because of the size of the tank. I didn't want to have to constantly refill it during the day, but I also did not want something that would be difficult to fill because of a large size. The unit stands taller than I expected, but it looks nice, so it's not an issue. With multiple computers and monitors in my office, the temp could easily rise to around 76 degrees F. The lowest seeting keeps my office at around 69 degrees (with no ice packs) and 40% humidity.The only issue I have with this unit is the way you have to read the water level. Other reviews stated the fact that it is difficult to read the water levels, and that is indeed true. There are five small windows on the front where you \"should be able\" to read the water level, but it is difficult and you will need a flashlight. I find that it is easier to use my flashlight and look inside the unit from the back. to do this, I have to move the unit away from the wall. Not a huge issue, but one that could be easily remedied with an update in the design.But, the unit does exactly what I needed it to do - cool my office. It is relatively quiet - I use it on the lowest Comfort setting. The oscillating feature is nice because it moves the air around my office. Sometimes I don't mind my office being a little warmer if I at least have moving air.I purchased a gallon water tank from Amazon for refilling. I find that when I set the unit to cool and the fan on 1 (it goes from 1-3), 7 gallons of water will last for 8 hours of continuous use.One thing to keep in mind is that this unit will add humidity to your environment. This works for my because my office is so dry. To prevent the buildup of excess humidity, you must have airflow to your room. So, with this unit, working with my door closed for long periods is not an option. On the first day of use, I left my door closed and the humidity go up to 60%. It seems as though the more humid it gets, the cooling is less effective. So, I keep my door open about halfway and I am comfortable all day. If I need to work with my door closed, I keep an eye on the humidity level with a small digital hygrometer on my desk. If it gets to high, I can turn the cooling function off for a while and just use the fan.Operation is very simple, the instructions were easy to follow, and the unit has just enough options. One thing that I would suggest is to maybe purchase a couple of better ice packs that stay cold longer.Excellent unit!!",

    "reviewText": "Bought 2 of these units. The worst part was putting the casters on. They did not go on easily, needed a mallet and screwdriver to slowly nudge them in. Instructions are inadequate. Had an issue with my cooler at less than a year old where the remote wasn't working properly on one, and worked perfectly on the other unit. Also, the pump was not evenly pumping water down the sides, only down the back. And I did use a de-scaler made for coolers periodically throughout its use. I also used filtered water.Contacted customer service, they were very responsive, and after some troubleshooting, they sent me a new cooler. They sent me a return label to send the old one back.This unit does the job and cools down my 15 x 25 foot studio space in 10 minutes on very hot days. I live in a hot, very dry climate. When not using the cool/water feature, the fan alove provides very nice air circulation, and I like that you can regulate the vents for the air to go where you want it.",

Evaporative coolers usually feel like they are blowing cool, humid air at you. These units feel like cool air with no added moisture. It also has wheels for easy mobility for everyone who needs it.

Keeps my living room cool from 95o outside to a nice 83o inside, and I only use it fan on 1 or 2 for the most part. If I am outside I will use 3 so it will be cool when I come back in. I had a bigger one (will not use name) but it was VERY LOUD!! this one even on 3 is much quieter and I have it in the same room as me @ about 15' away. So would say yes to getting this for your place. Remember it is NOT a Air conditioner so will NOT COOL YOUR WHOLE HOME. But it is very nice for it's size and did I say it is QUIET! Walter McL.

    "reviewText": "I have only had this a could of days and haven't decided if I will try to return this or not. It does a decent job of pushing out cool air if the ice packs are loaded. It is also compact and light weight and was easy to install. I use a humidifier at night, so this was a good way for me to get extra humidity in the house at the same time I'm cooling.The instructions are useless in telling you how to read the water level or how to remove the water tank to empty or clean it. Other reviews made me realize reading the water level is nearly impossible - so you just guess when you're filling it that you haven't overfilled. I still haven't figured out how to empty and/or clean the water tank. Also, several other reviews say it leaks and I just installed new wood flooring, so I'll have to buy a tray to put it on if I keep it. Hmmm...",

If you have a small room or you put that thing right on you, it’s not much better than a good fan.",

    "reviewText": "I’m using this in a large (~350 sq. ft.) bedroom that is far away from the home AC unit, and the duct work in our house is terrible, so the temp in our bedroom in the summer is always 4-5 degrees warmer than the rest of the house. We use this portable unit to reduce the temp the rest of the way. Works perfectly, and I don’t wake up at night sweating anymore! I couldn’t say if it would cool the room 100% in the dead heat of the summer, but it’s the perfect supplement when the central AC doesn’t do the full job.The only negative comment is that it was kind of annoying to vent it out the window, and I felt like I needed to supplement the window kit with some weather stripping, weather proofing, and special locks to feel safe and protected from the outside elements. But once I got it set up, I love it!",

My bedroom has little insulation as it’s a reformed attic so in the Summer when it’s above 70F outside, the room always feels extremely hot and muggy as all the cool air from the house escapes from the roof of my room. I’ll wake up sweating and have a hard time sleeping during the day (I work third shift). This aircon has been such a wonderful and welcome change. The only thing I will say, make sure to get some duct tape, or a thicker hose, to keep the hose in place on the unit as it started falling out due to the unit kicking out warm air. But other than that, I have no complaints and the unit works very well.",

I'm sitting right in front of it sweating. No way is my room 72. 82 degrees MAYBE. Which is better than the current 99 outside in TX. Every half hour or so it has a mini heart attack and shudders hard enough to rattle my window/floor. It's not so bad when it doesn't wake me up at night. I really wanted this to be better.

But so far we are satisfied. :-)I make some additions of info on this machine:It works with us from a 120 volt alternating current. I don't know if it would work well on the battery in a caravan vehicle. Additionally, this system is 28 inches tall by 12 wide; so it takes up space. For noise, it is acceptable if it is placed far enough away from where you sleep (we can compare it to the sound of a refrigerator).",

    "reviewText": "This review is about the VCJ Portable Evaporative Air Cooler, which i bought for our patio. I was looking for something for our back porch, to keep us cool during the summer. and we came across this Air-cooler. The Unit is about 41' or 42 in height, connects thru an AC power cord. (no batteries required.) Also included are 6 ice pks, to keep the water cool. (But you can also add ice) The water tank is at the bottom, water is pored into it from the top tray. which then goes down into the tank. the water tank fills up about 3-4 jugs. (which last a long time.) i believe 3 or 4 days, maybe longer. The unit has 4 wheels, easy for pushing or pulling, to place right where you want it. The front vents are moveable up or down. to get the cool air on that perfect spot. it blows enough air, (about 8 or 9 feet away.) Honesty the coldness is not gonna beat a real home A/C. I would say that while it does a good job at blowing a lot of air. the coldness is about a 6 or 7 out of 10. which means that you can feel it. So NO! it wont leave you sweating. or hot. It also comes with button that moves the air left and right (which i didnt even know when i bought it.) lol The Unit has a nob for power on and off, as well as how high you want it..Low mid or high. numbred as 1, 2, 3. Personally i liked it. my family likes it. even my dog loves the freash air., lol I would buy again for me or as a gift. If you are looking for a budget air cooling A/C for either indoors or out. give this1 a try.",

    "reviewText": "The fan is very strong, even on speed 1, cools down very quickly. It is rather noisy, especially if you have the louvers moving side to side. Definitely don’t want to move it around much with it full of water. I didn’t see how to clean dust/dog hair from the vents, but I’m assuming it should be done after the unit has not been running for an extended period of time so it would have time to dry and could be vacuumed? Over all, we are pleased with this unit so far. 😊 October 2023 The performance of this unit was good. It helped a lot on really hot summer days. We finally figured out how to access the filters, by disassembling most of the unit. The dog hair and dirt did not vacuum off and I was prepared to buy new filters. Replacement filters were nowhere to be found on Amazon or any of the local hardware stores. I was able to get a hold of the company through the Amazon message board just to find out that this unit and it’s filters are no longer available. They did offer a suggestion for cleaning, which worked pretty well, but doubt they will last more than one more summer. My advice is to find out whether or not replacement filters are available before you purchase a unit.",

    "reviewText": "It’s the right size and the right water capacity. The sealed tub design means no leaks. And I find it easier to drain using the plug than removing a tray.Although I use it mostly as a humidifier, it cools effectively when the air is dry. It works better than a real humidifier and requires no purified water.I have no problems with the water sensor at all. It only goes off if I forget to unplug it while draining it.The only draws backs are that it has an overly loud beep when pressing buttons, hardly much of a concern, and that the fan does not utilize the lower part of the opening. So run it on medium at night and high during the day to compensate.",

The 1300 CFM airflow is adequate, and the three-speed settings offer some flexibility. However, I found it to be a bit noisy at higher speeds, which can be distracting. Additionally, the cooling performance is just average, especially on really hot days. It's a good option if you need a portable cooler, but don't expect it to replace an air conditioner.",

Then, the seller requires the buyer to pay the return shipping cost; which is over $100. Almost the cost of the item. They may advertise returns and guarantees, but the buyer has to incur the costs for them to honor their policy. I wish Amazon would not let these types of sellers to use their site. Amazon users are accustom to no cost returns, and I've had sellers send me return shipping labels to honor a return or warranty policy. Poor product and even poorer customer service, if that's possible.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this 3 days before moving into my new 915 Sq foot place beginning of May this year.Works great, quiet, jeeps my new place cool throughout and have recommended this to several friends. I put the ice packs in the freezer when not in use and make sure there's always enough water so when I am home and put ice packs in, it constantly keeps cool air rotating around.Granted I only need it 3-4 months a year living in Oregon but it's summer now and it's making a difference. Energy saver as well :)",

In the humid southern climate (South of Atlanta) it did cool the air and was better than a fan blowing hot air, the cooler air did make a difference. Employee put an ice pack in the top of the unit and changed it out at lunch. Now speaking of the ice packs. They are worthless as far as quality goes. People in other reviews complained about it and I didn't think to much about it. However, after purchasing a total of 3 of these units within 3 days of each other every single ice pack for all three units has busted in the freezer after the 3rd or 4th time being froze. I am going to call the MFG and see what they say about it. I have other ice packs that I can use and will keep all 3 units.. But the reviews about the ice packs (they come with 2 each). (I got a total of 6 ice packs, and all but one has bust). all of them busted at different locations.",

    "reviewText": "We recently moved into a house in the mountains of Colorado, and most homes up here do not have a/c, including our house.With the windows closed all day while at work, the temp was getting up to 75-77 during the later afternoon hours (outside temps have been about 80, but lots of direct sunlight on the front of the house and coming in through the upper windows).When we get home, we open the windows and have the unit a foot or so in front of one. Even with only filling the unit with cold well water, it works great. Haven't needed to try the freezer packs. Cools the living room/dining room/kitchen area down to 68 or so within 30-45 min. The oscillating function really helps to make it feel cooler in the area 10-15 feet out from the unit.On it's highest setting, it has about the same noise level as a regular box fan on high.After two weeks of use, I took the back cover off to clean down inside the tank (pretty easy to do with only four screws to remove). Even with us using well water in it, there was only a very light film to clean in the bottom of the tank.Super easy to roll the unit into the kitchen to fill from the sink sprayer.I would definitely recommend this unit. So far, it's been worth every penny.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works really well until the water warms up (a suggestion for optimizing cold)...",
    "reviewText": "What these swamp coolers really need is a function that keeps the water cool because as soon as the water warms up, this becomes pretty useless. It works fantastic when the water is cold, but you'll likely run into the same problem I was in warm weather where the water gets too warm over time, even with the ice packs, and it begins to not work as well for cooling. What I suggest is this: if you will be using it for a long time like all day, don't fill the tank all the way. Fill it half-way and then fill it again later on with cold water and a new cold ice pack. That way, you aren't working with warm water the second half of the day.That issue aside, this does work very well with cold water. It almost feels air-conditioner-cold at first. It has a powerful air flow, too. I do like it a lot, I just wish it had a feature that keeps water cool!EDIT: A few days later, and both my ice packs split in the freezer, just like everyone else's. Sort of ridiculous that they include such horrible ice packs with this machine. I ordered six of these ice packs in Mini size (three of them fit in the top reservoir perfectly so I got three extras to keep cool while the first three are in use so I can rotate them): Igloo Performance Ice Blocks - Mini. They last much longer than the ice packs that came with this machine! I highly recommend that you get them, too.",

I was attracted by the appearance and design, having use an outdoor evap cooler on my patio I was hoping this would be an upgrade. Complete waste of money after only 4 to 5 weeks the pump that sends water to the cooling pads on 3 sides of the unit quit pumping water which leave you with a very inefficient fan blowing hot air. Contacted the company and after they had me trouble shoot the problem by opening it up and video taping my removing examining the pump they then wanted me to wait for a part and for me to install it. When I refused and expressed my frustration they apologized and sent me a “new” unit. I received the new unit a few days later. Now about 2 weeks later it too no longer works because the pump stopped working. Don’t waste your time and money on this product. “New” one heading to the trash heap.",

    "reviewText": "Living in Las Vegas, where temperatures soared to record highs of 114 degrees this year, finding effective cooling solutions for our large two-story home has been challenging. Traditional air conditioners alone couldn't handle the heat without driving up our electricity bills. That's when we discovered the Evaporative Cooler, VAGKRI 2100CFM Air Cooler, and it's been everything we were looking for.This cooler has been a lifesaver. Its powerful 2100CFM airflow and 120° oscillation feature ensure our entire home stays comfortably cool, from the living room to the upstairs bedrooms. What's truly impressive is its ability to add moisture to the dry desert air. This has greatly improved our indoor air quality, making it easier to breathe and significantly enhancing our overall comfort.The remote control and 24-hour timer add to its convenience, allowing us to adjust settings effortlessly and save energy by programming cooling times according to our schedule. Most importantly, using this evaporative cooler has slashed our electricity bill by nearly half compared to running our central AC constantly.The Evaporative Cooler, VAGKRI 2100CFM Air Cooler, has exceeded our expectations. It effectively cools, adds moisture to improve air quality, saves on energy costs, and enhances overall comfort. For anyone living in a hot, dry climate like Las Vegas, I highly recommend this cooler as a cost-effective and efficient cooling solution.",

    "reviewText": "When I first got the AC I was shocked as to how big it was as I was expecting something the size of a garbage can. After un packing it and setting it up (which didn't take long at all) I turned on the unit and was met with the coldest breeze I had felt all summer, I was very happy with it and then my landlord/friend pushed a button and the AC kicked in and the air got cold real quick. I have been using the AC in my room when I sleep and in my game room when I play VR or just want to play a game or enjoy a movie. This is the BEST thing I have ever gotten and in this heat right now with temperatures here in Alberta Canada almost in the mid 30s early 40s range...this is a godsend of a device.I Do not regret purchasing and if I had more cash I would have bought a second one.Easy to use and the big fan blows nice cold air outwards and the the huge reservoir tank keeps things cool for a good 5 hours or more.Be aware this unit is not to be used in huge rooms as its not quite that strong to cool that room quickly, this unit is best used in a small room or bedroom or even a medium sized theater or game room.Works best with ice packs and cold water from a bathtub run into a small sized pail or ice cream bucket.Not certain how it would work outdoors at is does come with a garden hose attachment. Energy wise I will find out if this unit uses up a lot of electricity or not when the bill comes in that is one thing more people never talk about when doing a review.Still a fantastic Portable AC that for the price asking is a good investment on a truly hot summer.",

I usually have to fill it 1-2x a day depending on how hot it is and how high I have the fan, I also usually have the switch out ice packs a few times a day as well. It’s definitely not an ac but it does cool the air quite nicely. The only downfall are the ice packs, they’re essentially useless. Ice packs I had on hand cooled way better. Their ice packs broke after a week and only stayed frozen for maybe 30 minutes before I had to re freeze. I recommend the unit but I would definitely buy different ice packs to go with it.",

    "reviewText": "With a slight tune these can sound great, the bottom end can get a little mushy at times, not unbearably so. The cable is short, though for me that's perfect since I primarily use them with my laptop. They are a good compromise for portability, audio quality, and price. The sound quality of the drivers is better than any wireless headphones I've heard by this point, although that's more of a limitation of bluetooth that a wired headset doesn't have to deal with.The audio sounds like a slightly stankier version of my iems, the microphone has a little hum with no filtering, but even a subtle noise filter takes care of it well without destroying the audio quality. The mic is honestly better than most gaming headsets I've ever heard or used, even from headsets that cost triple what these do.Overall I'd say these are a very solid setup, if the cable proves to be too short a simple extension doesn't hurt to have ditto on a splitter if you need it. Would recommend for laptop use.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Complete Junk",
    "reviewText": "I have two pairs of these (one for me and one for my housemate). They are precisely the same.First, the microphone is VERY loose. Like, you can knock it out of the socket with an aggressive whip of the head. Furthermore, don't bother trying to replace it, because I tried two others and they fit the same and didn't work and it's hard to fit a replacement since there is a small recess that most options don't fit into.Second, the sound quality is terrible. It's \"fine\" at moderate to low volume, if a little anemic. However, at anything approaching medium loud to loud, they distort heavily and are absolutely unlistenable. Any significant bass breaks up and crackles and it's clear continued use will blow out the drivers.Finally, you can't fit any aftermarket tips on these. Everything just pops off. So, don't bother trying to get foam tips or other better isolating solutions. They won't fit. Even if they fit on the buds, they will not hold and will stay in your ear when you remove the buds.Find a different solution. These are like 10x the cost they should be given the quality and other options out there.",

    "reviewText": "I bought these so that I would not have headphone hair whenever I play video games and plan on going out later. They work great and have good sound quality when they are snug in your ear. However, these tend to come loose from your ear with any minor movement that you make and after about 20 minutes of use, the band that goes over your ear starts to dig in and hurt. Overall, I would not really recommend these. I would rather spend a bit more to get something a bit more comfortable and better sounding such as the Razer Hammerhead Duo.",

    "reviewText": "I already have the SteelSeries Arctis 7P+ headset and love them with my PS5....best headset I've ever owned even compared to the proprietary Sony playstation headsets....so I trusted the name already. Sometimes the full on headset is just too imersive as I game in the same room as I watch TV with my wife. Sometimes for more casual gaming sessions I need just one ear in the game and keep an ear for her as well. The full headset is akward to wear over one ear for an extended period, so I like the wired ear bud as an alternative. I can just put one earbud in and still hear whats going on around me in the house. I used to love the PSVita mobile wired headset but they broke and its no longer available so the search began for the replacement. I found this mobile gaming headset from the company I already know makes high quality products and gave them a try. The sound is increadible and the mic is super clear and chat friends say it produces perfect sound. I did compare the included boom mic adapter vs the inline mic but they said they were both good but the built in mic souded even better. I thought a boom mic on an earbud was strange but you don't even need it. I fired up COD MW2 and cranked the max volume as a test and it was actually too loud even though it was super clear. When I shot the shotgun it sounded like I was shooting a real shotgun without ear protection!!! I like the top end volume to be too much and that tells you it is a real prformer! Definately recommend this even as a primary gaming headset or mobile. No distortion at high levels and COD footsteps were easy to hear....",

    "reviewText": "As the headline said, the boom mic introduces echo and buzzing, the exact opposite of what I'd intended by buying a more expensive headset. Plus, they only record at 16 bit, 48KHz, well below anything reasonable. Save your money and buy a $5 headset if you want the boom mic, because this one simply isn't fit for purpose. The only bright side is the comfort and the audio out, but the difference of $35 between this and the boom-mic headset I got at 5 Below isn't justified for that.",

(And then the mic started having issues)The Main Point:I’ve been using these for a couple months now, and the mic works, and the audio is fine. The wrap-around thing is way more comfortable than it hanging out of my ear-hole. I did invest in some memory foam earbud tips though. Highly suggest it.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this for the detachable boom microphone only which rtings.com reviewed this unit pretty well.I was after a really clear microphone that was very portable and this was among the top of the list, at a reasonable price.The boom microphone will not disappoint you. Sure it might stand out on a call, but you are serious about being heard, aren't you?I couldn't believe how good it was for doing next to nothing. There can be an ever so slight hiss on the mic reported by some which you could only pick up on if you were really looking for it.Mostly my voice is the brightest and clearest on most of the calls I'm on, which I was after, and for the odd explanation via video recording on teh go. I can set it high enough that it doesn't pick up my keyboard or clicking or a laptop fan nearby. This is light and serviceable enough to put in my bag as a backup or primary when bluetooth might be flaky, or batteries run out. The carrying bag with it is handy to not lose the parts as it stores better with the boom mic attached.If I was giving a presentation on a teams/zoom call, I would probably pick this up first knowing how good it was right away without any adjustment or software overhead required.The audio quality for listening is decent, but not great as expected, and maybe more appealing to gamers, but for me I just needed clear audio on calls and recording. If you do find the higher frequencies a little too sharp in your ears (which I did), it is easy enough to find an EQ program for your computer or device that you can tamp down those values. I don't blast things that high.",

I also dont like the quality of the mic and it peaks very easily despite me keeping it away from my mouth most of the time.

Upon setting the device up the sound quality leaves a bit to be desired; directly comparing it to the same device utilized with the same hardware setup previously. I bought this because I lost the wireless dongle (found outjust 5 minutes ago logitech sells this replacement piece for $15 - so I sort of paid 3x as much given I didn't need the headset or charging cable which is my mistake -. Some of the sound is bad when the headset is trying to recreate a specific audio range, there is no interference or anything conflicting. Sound in general is worse than the sound from my monitor. 3/5, should be a 4/5 product had it before better sound",

    "reviewText": "The refurbished headset arrived on time in great shape with the USB charger cord and USB wireless receiver. (It did not come with a storage bag or carrying case.) I was surprised that there were no instructions included – essentially, just a small reference sheet with a link to the Logitech website where more information is available and important software can be downloaded.The headset is relatively lightweight and the comfortable circumaural speakers swivel to conform to the curves on the sides of the head. The sound is very clear for both the microphone and speakers. The microphone can be muted and the speakers have a volume control. The microphone \"boom\" can be folded out of the way by pushing it up to a vertical position. However, unexplained in the flyer or on the website is the important information that the microphone itself can be stowed out of the way by pushing it down into the tubular boom when not in use. To use the microphone, the microphone boom should be lowered and the microphone itself should be gently pulled out of the boom tube about an inch to extend it to be closer to the mouth. The microphone is attached to a flexible \"gooseneck\" pipe that can be bent to an optimized position for voice pickup. It should be noted that the microphone should to be fully extended to work properly. I discovered that if it is not fully extended, the signal from the microphone may sometimes drop out. This is very easily fixed simply by gently pulling the microphone out of the boom to its maximum extension length.The broadcast range, I would estimate, was between 20 to 30 feet, depending on the presence of obstructions such as walls or distance away from the wireless receiver.I'm very pleased with the refurbished headset and its discounted price. I would certainly consider purchasing it again (especially as a gift).",

    "reviewTitle": "Capable, no-nonsense wireless headset",
    "reviewText": "This G533 Wireless was my first \"Amazon Renewed\" purchase. From what I've read, more often than not these are returned unused products. I was in luck as this was obviously a return that wasn't used at all.It came in a nondescript box, with the headset and accessories inserted in a Ziploc bag. The charging cable and wireless dongle are authentic Logitech G accessories, and were bubble-wrapped separately. All the protective peel-offs on the headset were also intact and undisturbed. And most importantly, the ear cups and headband cushion were extremely clean. The original packaging was probably damaged so technically it couldn't be sold as \"new\".Anyhow, once I got it unboxed, I plugged in the receiver and turned on the headset. Immediately G Hub recognized it. I ran it through the sound test and it was great, with no discernible distortions. Mind you, it wasn't perfect, but it's certainly good enough. I then tested the mic using Zoom as well as doing recordings through Windows., Although they weren't superb, my voice was clear and understandable - certainly good enough for Discord.Although I do find it somewhat bulky and heavy, it sits comfortably on my head, and the cups fit over my ears snugly. The overall fit is firm, but not constrictive. I also like how the the mic extends and retracts as well, and the flex is adequate and not flimsy.I'm more than satisfied with this purchase. The only caveat being it's limited connectivity. It would've been nice if this was Bluetooth-enabled, or at the least if it had wired functionality. Regardless, the G533 Wireless is a very capable, no-nonsense headset, fit for any gamer. Happy shopping!Edit: After having these for a few days now, I will say it does start feeling tight during long sessions. And my ears do get hot after awhile being confined in the cups. If these had more breathability, and a way to lessen the tension somehow, these would be perfect. Still, this thing's a keeper in my books!",

    "reviewTitle": "Bought two 'refurbished', they are perfect!",
    "reviewText": "Main reason for choosing this was because my son's 3.5mm jack on his Nintendo Switch failed. We needed a work around to get him able to use his mic and headphone abilities again playing with friends online. The headsets USB plugs right into the switch dock or directly into the base of the switch with the dongle and this headset becomes fully functional.Tip: if it doesn't work immediately, shut down the software of the game (or switch completely-not sleep) and start back up with the USB plugged in already then check your switch settings and make sure the headset is selected for mic and headset use. This also works on the PS5.We bought a second headset for my other son 2 days after we received the first headset as he would need one for his switch in the event his 3.5mm jack fails and also for playing the PS5 wirelessly (the 3.5mm jacks are on the base of the controllers-pretty cool).The headsets 'refurbished', the two I purchased 2 days apart came in their original boxes (boxes in good shape) and in brand new condition with their original hardware. The headsets look like someone simply tried them and returned them-possibly thinking they were Bluetooth because there is nothing wrong with these sets. They function exactly as expected. Even the silica bags were included in both headsets still.The sound is amazing and the range is excellent. We can walk around the entire house with no interference or dip in sound quality. My oldest son was envious of my younger one receiving this upgraded headset for Christmas. I tried it out before gifting it to him being a 'refurbished' item while gaming on my PC. It sounds amazing. Yes a bit heavy, and does feel a bit warm after a while but it's quality and just a matter of getting used to it compared to the cheaper wired sets we had been using before. Once the headset was tested in all 3 systems we needed it for I purchased the second headset, it's condition was identical to the first I received. The seller was Cyber-Global and fulfilled by Amazon.",

The sound is great , well took a little twick in settings, for 7.1 but I really love the sound. The 7.1 emulation works great, and I can understand the sound direction in games, it is very loud too, so one of the first headsets that I mainly using on lowest volumes, mic works great, the logitech soft works great. It was shipped very fast and I don't see anything else near that quality for the price i've payd ( I spend more on mu lunch to be honest) The only downgrade for me - it keep a bit of heat on my head, but it is a very minor complaint",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This was a gift for my son, and he is enjoying it immensely.Especially the ease of use, the lights, the ability to hold things in the tray. He also likes that it blends in well when turned off (see pic), but the lights then match the rest of his accessories when they’re all on (sorry - no pic).I’m glad he’s happy and will certainly keep the product, but my only 2 ‘complaints’ would be:1) While the assembly was simple and didn’t require instructions (plain box, 3 parts, absolutely no further info), I still would have liked some basic instructions instead of relying solely on intuition.I found the pole fit better one way (less wobbly) than the other and I tried to not push too hard in case it’s not intended to ‘snap’ into place either and broke - rendering it useless.2) If I’m correct and it’s not suppose to ‘snap in’; that the pole portion of the stand itself feels flimsy and weak. It isn’t as solid as I’d like and it still wiggles more than I’d like to see on an item that will get daily use (see video). So I do worry I will have to replace the entire thing if he’s not careful and it snaps. Or I’m considering gluing it at both ends to give it more stability and longevity.We’ll see what happens!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Some may experience a quiet mic & Experiences setting up Sidetone",
    "reviewText": "This is not going to be a review of the quality of the headphones as there is already a lot of very valid information and opinion on that topic in the reviews here and on the web. I'm going to focus on a a challenge I had and how it was solved, in an attempt to help others who may experience the same issue.The headphones are designed specifically to interface with the 3.5mm jacks on your computer (or phone for that matter). They come with two cables - one that ends in a combo mic/headphone jack and one that splits into separate mic and headphone jacks. I haven't used the combo, i have solely used these headphones on my gaming PC and used the split cable. Its relevant to say that I use these for Sim racing and need to hear the car and environment sounds, but also communicate with other drivers.So, after plugging in the headphones everything functioned great. But the microphone was very quiet - basically inaudible to other users. This is easily fixed however by the windows settings for the microphone - go to levels and set volume to max and boost to max (+30dB). If you cant find the boost slider then you may need to update your drivers or go through the soundcard dedicated software (which is sometimes tricky to find..). This should get you up and running with all computers.The next thing was i had no idea how much of a benefit 'sidetone' has been giving me. My previous headphones had this built in (Astro A50 wireless - older generation). Basically sidetone takes the unfiltered microphone signal from the mic and sends it directly to the speakers in the headphones, allowing you to hear what you are saying. The isolation these headphones provide from the outside world, plus the relatively loud volume of the sim, meant my voice was completely inaudible to myself. Fine for others in the game hearing me though. For some this wont be a big deal, but for others that have had headphones with this feature in the past it might be very weird. I can imagine living without this feature in a sim racing setup as communications are infrequent, but with other games that require constant communication it would be too much of a compromise for me personally.So, to setup sidetone there are a few options. First, you need to understand that it is not a feature that Beyerdynamic has in any of its regular (non-broadcast focused) headphones. There are 2 options you can try in windows right off the bat. The first is under mic settings and check the box for 'listen to this device'. The positive to this is that it provides clear and loud signal from your mic to your headphones. The well documented catastrophic failing (for this use) is the lag - it is unbearable. Other users may have a different experience, but mine was very negative. The second option is to go through the speaker settings, the levels tab, and find the input that corresponds to the mic (it could be simply 'microphone' or something a bit more obscure like 'FB in) just max the volume slider and uncheck the mute to find which one gives sidetone). Once you've done that you should have good sidetone with no lag. Within the windows environment there maybe more options related to 3rd party software. Musicians may be able to provide more guidance on how DAW software deals with this.I had two different experiences. On my non-sim rig the volumes were just fine and the amount of sidetone was okay. I did have to boost the mic volume up to max vol and 20dB boost (one notch down from max), which introduced a fair amount of hiss into the equation - but I was trying a comparison to my sim rig settings and deliberately turned up higher than what you would need in an office type environment or 'light gaming' were headphone volumes are much lower. Note that both setups only had motherboard based on-board sound, not separate internal or external soundcards. This may give you additional options - but do the research, sometimes the options focus on the sound out and not the sound in.if my sim rig had the same sidetone volume as my other PC then I would probably have stopped there, but the volumes were just too low. The next option get complicated. Sidetone is what we call something that musicians use all the time. For a singer, being able to hear their own voice is critical, and this is called 'mic monitoring'. The setups are quite straight forwards but need additional components. The first thing you need to know is that the mic on this headset is not a passive mic. Its a back-electret design that needs a voltage (not really a current incidentally). You may not know this, but your computer mic-in actually provides a voltage (3.2v on my sim computer, 2.8V on my other PC). Any setup that doesn't provide a voltage between 1.5v and 9.0v to the mic will simply not work. As a note, within this voltage range it seems that the level of voltage doesn't change the level of mic output. its more like a switch for an amplifier circuit in the mic itself. it works or it doesn't.The setup that worked for me was to buy either a USB audio interface (M-Audio 192/4) or a stage type 'personal monitor' - but critically it needs to be something that can supply something called Phantom Power. This is a 48v signal that is 'sent' to the mic. It is designed for high quality condenser mics - i.e. not this one! (desk mounted separate mics for podcasts or studios etc are often condenser mics). So to make this work you need to step down the voltage to something in the acceptable window. On the Beyerdynamic website it states that 48v will damage the mic., it might not, but don't be temped to try it - you may regret your decision. Instead a component like the Rode VXLR+ adapter is what you need. Plug that in in series with your mic-in in your new piece of kit (m-audio for me), hook up the device to your computer using suitable cables (XLR to 3.5mm jack for the mc and 1/4\" jack to 3.5mm jack for the line out from your computer). Enable phantom power to power the mic, and you now should be able to get a good loud mix of sidetone direct from the mic and game audio (or whatever) from your computer.Note: On the Beyerdynamic website it states that you need to find a Phantom Power to T-Power adapter. You do not need to do this. T-Power is 12v, could damage your mic and is exceptionally difficult to find as it is basically obsolete technology - Phantom power replaced it. To be accurate what you need (and what I created) is called 'Plug in power' - a low voltage Phantom Power, just like the soundcard in the computer.This journey took me many hours and a lot of wasted time as I discovered more things I never knew. I had to back out of a few rabbit holes and return a few items that didn't work out. Just be aware that if the windows options don't provide the volume you need, you may need to return the product for a SteelSeries/Astro/etc that do have sidetone, or jump in with both feet and start buying cables and electronics to do the job with the beyers.The end result is I have high quality headphones, and clear loud sidetone that is controllable and mixable, and the ability to control my speakers from the same USB interface. Additionally my electric guitar may be dusted off an I may try my hand at recording - that is really what the USB audio interface is designed for - not us gamers!I hope this helps someone that has similar questions. And all of the above is correct to my knowledge, but my knowledge is less than a week old, so if anything in the writeup above is incorrect, i ask that you be constructive with feedback!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars If I could describe these headphones in one word it would be clarity.",
    "reviewText": "For someone just getting into more expensive headphones for gaming, these are it. They hit way higher than their price point.The important part first. Keep in mind that these are closed back. Stock pads and no EQ: The highs are clear, albeit bright. The mids are present and well defined, the bass is a bit lacking, but what bass it does have is precise and enjoyable.I have been using these headphones daily for four months now. Easily the best headphones I have listened to so far. I use them for gaming mostly but also jam out to music as well. If I could describe these headphones in one word it would be clarity. Using these to play games is like cheating as long as the game has a good sound engine. You can hear precisely where people are. While I’m not traditionally someone that listens to it, in classical music you can hear the individual instruments and the friction on the strings. Acoustic guitar music also has also been extremely enjoyable on these. That is what completely blew me away. My similarly priced IEM’s that used to be my previous “big soundstage” set can’t even compete with this level of clarity. One thing I struggled to find while I was looking at reviews for this headset is the microphone quality. The microphone quality sounds amazing. While not a stand mic sound, it sounds far better than any headset I’ve tried or listened to before. I often get asked what I'm using to talk with while in discord and even in some games due to the unique sound of a clear and bassy mic.The only potential negative I can mention is the wire leading to the cans. I wish that it was either replaceable or had some sort of reinforcement sleeving around it. I've had no issues so far but I feel like it is its weakest link. Secondly, the wire leading from the cans to the audio source is a strange 5 pole, and to my knowledge, there is no replacement to get rid of the inline microphone mute switch which has no shirt clip. I won't deduct any stars for these though as they are just design choices, not issues. Perhaps on v3?Advice to future owners of these:Bass can be boosted with alternative earpads, which in my experience also reduced the highs to a more comfortable level.Also, please note that to me, these sounded awful on integrated sound. I do not care if your motherboard said it can power up 600ohms. You need power. I know they are 32Ohm, but they need dedicated power. Doesn’t take much. I didn't want to spend too much money on audio equipment since I was already spending so much on the headset. I bought two soundcards, tried it using onboard, then I bought a Schitt Fulla and then finally a SteelSeries GameDac. The Schitt Fulla was great, but the Steel Series GameDac did just as well for these specific headphones, and as an added bonus it provides a game chat balance on a dial, plus you can tune down the highs so it is not so sharp using its built-in EQ. Keep DTS off if you go this route. Yes, it is more money to add on to what is already an expensive headset, but trust me, properly powering these is worth it.Lastly, on Amazon they sell headband covers for the DT770, they fit these. It protects the headband and the one I got was easily washable.",

    "reviewText": "For me it works perfectly. I am regular user of MMX 300 2nd gen. So I decided to buy lastest model and I am not disapointed. Mine is paired with AE-9 Soundcard. Basicaly MMX 300 Pro feel same build quality and slightly better sound thanks to new drivers. Sound suprised me positively. Headset is comfortable. I have no idea why other not happy as this is one of the best Gaming Headset you can buy.There is one thing that I dont like however that is not going to make me give 4 star. It is missing hard case and other accesories this time not part of package. But perhaps it is understandable with current trends. Is it worth it $299? Probably not... more like $250.I can easily recommend this headset to anybody who want one of the best Gaming headset currently on the market.",

    "reviewTitle": "Disappointed Beyond Belief!!",
    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro headphones for $300, expecting a premium experience given the hefty price tag. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.First and foremost, comfort is key when it comes to headphones, and I had high hopes that these would deliver. Sadly, they felt anything but comfortable. The ear cushions are stiff and don’t conform to the shape of my ears at all. After just a short period of use, I found myself constantly adjusting them and taking breaks, which defeats the purpose of having a high-end headset for long gaming or listening sessions.Additionally, the headband feels rigid and offers very little cushioning, leading to discomfort on the top of my head. I had expected a luxurious feel and fit, but instead, it feels like I’m wearing a cheap pair of headphones.For $300, I was anticipating a level of quality and comfort that this product simply does not deliver. I wish I could say the sound quality made up for it, but if I can’t wear them comfortably, it hardly matters. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere if you value comfort as much as sound quality.Overall, I regret this purchase and would not recommend the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable audio experience. Save your money!",

    "reviewText": "Cuffie acquistate per utilizzo con PlayStation 5. Le cuffie sono ben costruite, sono comode e la qualità audio è ottima. Il problema è il microfono. Il cavo delle cuffie ha i jack separati per audio e microfono, quindi per collegarle al controller della PS5 è necessario utilizzare l’adattatore fornito nella confezione che unisce i due jack in uno solo. Tuttavia, una volta collegate al controller, il microfono non viene riconosciuto come collegato e viene utilizzato quello incorporato nel controller. Ho testato le cuffie su un PC, registrando un campione vocale sia con adattatore che con i jack separati e il microfono funziona correttamente in entrambi i casi, quindi il problema sembra essere proprio un’incompatibilità con la PS5, nonostante dovrebbero esserlo. Purtroppo ho dovuto effettuare il reso.",

Fully extended it's comfortable on the 13 year old but a little small for everyone else.The audio is okay. Far from great but good enough to hear directional stuff in game. The mic sounds kinda cheap. It came through clear but people said I sounded like I was talking into a can. If you're locked in at this price point and have a smallish head, they're fine. They feel like they'd last a while.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted a pair of wireless gaming headphones for work and some casual gaming. My criteria were:- Good microphone- Bluetooth and 2.4GHz so I can switch between my computer and phone- Fabric earcups (I run hot)- Good sound qualityI work from home, so I don't need active noise canceling. These headphones fit the bill 100%. I was concerned that because they were refurbished, they might the 2020 version, but these are indeed the 2023 version.I'm not an audiophile, but to my ears, they sound really good. They don't have the same wide soundstage as my open ear wired headphones, but I'm OK with the tradeoff. Music is clear and crisp, great separation, though there's a little distortion at the upper volumes. I can't tolerate that amount of loudness so it's not an issue.The microphone is amazingly clear, such that a coworker commented on it during a call. It's not podcast quality, but it's leaps and bounds better than the compressed tin can sound that most gaming mics deliver.Last big plusses are: Great range. I can walk around the house and a bit in the yard without dropouts. Maybe 40 feet or so with walls? Really impressive. And the battery life is great. I haven't come close to running out of juice. I just plug it in for a bit every few days. I also like how there's preset EQ on the cans. I can adjust levels while I'm on my Mac.On the minus side, the simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz isn't as smooth as I'd hoped. If I'm listening to music on my phone and I get an audio notification on my computer, the music pauses and I have to restart it manually. I was hoping they'd be more…simultaneous. And the clamping force is a little higher than my wired headphones. I have a big ol' melon of a head, so that's more a problem of genetics than the headphones. I can still wear them all day if I adjust them just right…Great deal compared to the retail price! I was surprised how good the condition was. They might as well have been brand new. I'm very satisfied on all levels!",

    "reviewText": "These headphones are incredible! I used to use the Corsair Void RGB Elite for the 7.1 sound. These vastly exceed the quality of Corsair. The software, Razer Synapse, works much better than Corsair iCue. These headphones have a compressor feature that brings down loud sounds and increases quiet sounds (Footsteps specifically in competitive games??). The only negative is that the ear cups are slightly small. I have small ears, that lay closer to my head, and somehow these still put pressure on the top or sides of my ears. I couldn't see myself liking these if I had medium or large ears. I swapped the ear cups out for cooling replacements from Wicked Cushions. Best choice to enhance these to their max.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars This is a simple plastic tool. Not the greatest",
    "reviewText": "The metal rod and the hole does not fit right out of the box. You must carefully force it down that hole. It is as if there is a missing wooden or plastic dao or insert piece that joins the rod into the inside of the hole in the base.Simple LED base works as advertised. When you light up the LED you can see on the bottom curve of the base there are two dark spots, and then two more dark spots again at the back .The wireless charger does work for tiny devices like your true wireless earbuds case, smartwatch, but there is no rubber it's all plastic making it very slippery.It will gingerly hold your 1 overear headphones but you may need to get rubber or silicone tape to keep it in place.",

    "reviewText": "A couple years ago i bought the Corsair HS70 which lasted me about a year. And then bought the Sennheiser EPOS GSP 302 headset which has an amazing microphone.Anyways, about this headset. The headset has really really good audio. Amazing bass (im a bass head) and really clear highs. And what i really appreciate is the lack of muddy mids. Deep bass and clear treble is good, but no muddy mids is even better. Clearity should be ehat you're after and these headphones check that box.However... the comfort of this headset is quite unpleasing. My previous HS70 LE headset was amazingly comfortable but these HS50 Pros aren't exactly comfortable. They sit on your head well which is one thing but they clamp quite hard on your head. Along with that is the somewhat rough headband. I start to recieve nausea and a mild headache from the earpads and headband so i did return these. But for a sub 14year old i would definitely recommend.",

    "reviewText": "I wear these basically all day for meetings, music, podcasts, and gaming.Pros:Good, though not amazing sound quality. I think these provide good sound for this price point. Plenty of clarity and range. The microphone works just fine, and the ear pads do a good job with passive \"noise cancellation.\" I also find them reasonably comfortable.Cons:After not quite 3 years of use, the plastic/vinyl/whatever material that coats the ear and head cushions has started peeling off pretty badly. It just flakes off. Also, the ear cups are coming detached from the main housing of the speakers. I've already repaired one with epoxy, but the epoxy did not bond well to the plastic, so I'm going to have to try again, probably with electrical tape. Hopefully they are repairable, because I like the sounds quality of these headphones, and it would be a shame to have to chuck them because the stupid ear cup won't stay attached.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased two of these. One for myself and one for my boyfriend. His only lasted two weeks. They are made of very cheap plastic and the ear piece broke right off during light use. Both of ours have had recurring mic issues related to compatibility issues with Windows 11. The mic randomly gets super boosted and activates even when there is no speaking going on. It is extremely loud and painful to anyone listening to the conversation. We found two ways of resolving this. One was to download their update platform and force an update even if there is none. This took a lot of time and only resolves the issue for a few hours. The other solution was to simply unplug the USB and plug it back in, but this only ever worked half the time and also only resolved the issue for a few hours.THIS THING IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Technical issues aside, the sound quality is not that great. I ended up replacing his with a cheap $30 headset that works far better and has no issues whatsoever. Steer clear of this abomination!",

    "reviewTitle": "2.0 out of 5 stars All the non-core features are bad, and they get in the way of the core features",
    "reviewText": "This headset is comfortable, the audio is good, the battery life is good. I really like that the mic flips up and down and mute itself when you do so. All the things you think about with a headset are on point. I wish I could end the review there, but everything else makes this thing a pain to use.The main reason I went with this is because I already use some other Corsair peripherals with iCUE. Using this headset with iCUE is actively worse than without. First and foremost, when you're not using iCUE, the headset uses a series of beeps to for audio feedback when you mute or unmute. These beeps are very clear, and they vary in tone in a manner that makes it intuitive whether what you just did was to mute or unmute. These beeps sound whether you click the physical mute button or flip the mic up or down. When the headset is controlled by iCUE, these beeps are completely disabled, and you're left with two options: No mute sounds at all, or use the extremely grating voice prompts. Why can't I just hear the beeps? It makes no sense.You can replace the voice prompt audio with your own .WAV files, but what you'll find is that iCUE has a something like a half-second delay in reading custom .WAV files, and even if there wasn't, there's no active audio connection. The audio connection only starts when audio plays, and it takes an additional half-second *after* audio starts for anything to get to the headset, so it cuts off the first half of the audio. In practice, this means if you have a second long audio clip, you'll only hear half of it. If you have a half-second long audio clip, you'll hear nothing. Why send audio feedback through the audio channel instead of playing them natively on the headset? It makes no sense.Note that this is through the USB dongle with a dedicated connection to the headset. I understand that the various versions of Bluetooth will have these latency and cut-off issues, and that's the main reason why I chose this headset that comes with a dongle. Why does the dongle have the same issues that Bluetooth does? Does the dongle use Bluetooth for its connection? If so, then *what is the point of the dongle*? All phones, all laptops, all consoles, and most desktop PCs (mine included) have Bluetooth built-in. Why ship a dongle that has all the downsides of not having a dongle? It makes no sense.Also, when connected through the dongle, infrequently (but extremely noticeably) something goes completely wrong and the microphone audio just totally corrupts. I haven't had the pleasure of hearing it myself, but multiple times have the people I'm talking to started freaking out about how I was getting sucked into a wormhole. When this happens, it doesn't stop, and the only way to get the audio back in working order is to unplug and replug the dongle. Turning the headset off and back on doesn't even work. I don't know if it's a driver issue or what, but I can't risk a losing customer or client trust because my hardware just fails in the middle of something.So throw the dongle out, right? Just use Bluetooth natively. Yeah, I tried that too. The latency issues with the headset are much worse than what I see with other Bluetooth devices, outside of my $5 set of earbuds. This thing is $50 ($100 with the dongle that makes the experience worse), they couldn't have put a better Bluetooth module in it? I've used no-name speakers with better Bluetooth. Why put inferior components in your mid-range device? I'd say it makes no sense, but it's really just cost cutting at the expense of consumers who don't know any better. (Un)Fortunately for me, I do know better.And one last issue, and last because this might just be my system, but when the headset is connected via Bluetooth, Windows Audio Service uses upwards of 5 GB of RAM and some 10-15% of CPU on my 13th Gen Intel i7. I don't see other connected devices, audio or otherwise, using this amount of resources. On top of that, the headset broadcasts itself as multiple different devices, presumably one to connect to the dongle and one (or more?) to connect via native Bluetooth. This makes it really hard to isolate and troubleshoot any issues, because it's not easy to tell if you need to look at \"CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS Gaming Headset\" or \"CORSAIR HS55 Stereo\" or \"CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS HANDS-FREE AG\" or whatever else in device manager or sound settings.I put up with all these issues for a month, swapping between connection methods, trying different settings, googling workarounds, convincing myself that there must be a way to make this thing good. After a month, I have found that there is not. There's no way to use this thing that isn't aggressively bad in one way or another. I wish I could pick and choose different aspects of the different connection methods and combine them into a singular, cohesive, and broadly good experience, but it's not possible. And since the return window closes after 30 days, I guess I'll just be out the cash with a bad product that could be good but isn't. If this is the sort of experience I can expect from Corsair, then I guess I know not to get any further invested in the ecosystem.",

    "reviewText": "This is hands down the best headset for the value, it easily competes with headsets that are $350. This headset shines in every aspect, materials, comfort, lightweight, build quality, sound quality, and only lacks a little bit in microphone quality. This headset also has flip to mute, and volume control/mic monitoring scroll wheels on the headset. The mic quality isn’t the best compared to headsets like the steel series arctis pro, it also has noise cancellation like the arctis pro. That headset costs an extra $100! ($250 wired/$300 wireless). It bullies it in every other category besides mic quality. This headset has the best soundstage and ease of use compared to any headset that is within $250 of this headset. No other headset even comes close to the rig 800 HD. Not to mention, it’s wireless, which is huge for only $150. I would pay $350 for this headset if that’s what it was sold for. I love everything about this headset, the price, lightweight, great build quality and materials, durability. This beats every other gaming headset by a mile.",

    "reviewText": "Purchased this to replace my gen 1 Astro A50 that I've used for years and the batteries have recently finally stopped working. The headband is larger which is why I bought this. However, there is always connection issues or glitches with this. When I take it off the charging dock and hold down the power button. It'll either say: \"Headset connection\", \"Headset Disconnected\", \"Headset powered on\", or a combination of these. Sometimes It'll connect on the first try but most of the time, it'll require me to hold down the button twice to try and turn it on. There's also been a few times that it wouldn't connect and I then realize that the dongle is flashing red. At which point I would have to take out then plug back in the dongle.Recently, the microphone has also been having issues with audio detection or for some reason the people that I talk to could barely hear me.I never had these issues with my Astros but their new A50X headband are smaller than the original so I can't go back to those...I do not expect these issues with a headset that is this expensive.-----Update:The microphone has now started to sound like I'm talking from the other side of the room. I can't tell if this is a lemon or if it's the normal quality of this headset.",

    "reviewText": "So far I've been using RIG product for few years, previously using RIG 500E and giving me a good impression for wearing for long section comfort for the headset, even listen to music is great.RIG 800 Pro is a great wireless headset in my opinion, this headset can go pretty loud even you max out can listen the detail without wear it. Great memory form earcup but the isolation for the headset not that good and wear for long section can easily sweat. Battery life is great with the charging port but why micro USB? Build quality for this headset is still same as my old RIG 500e plastic but lightweight and feels like weightless while wearing on it.I've been trying on gaming for few games like competitive fps games I can hear very detail footstep from which direction coming from. For music I can hear more detail than before the bass is quite loud and detail, listening to J-rock song makes the song pack a punch. Even I enjoy watching movie with this headset is great!But If you looking for a good mic headset, this is not a product for you. The mic is bad, really bad. I can't speak softly but keep picking up my environment sound like fans or my mouse clicking.And I had tired connect to my Nintendo switch through my dock and it works!Great upgrade and I love it.",

    "reviewText": "Bought two pairs of this headphone and happy with both of them. Bought these PC ones and the set for Xbox Series X. Both are very comfortable, battery life is very good and durability is good. I use the Xbox pair for several hours a night and barely notice they are there. Sound quality is good, obviously not studio monitor quality but for wireless and this price, they are worth it. I have been through 3 pairs of Turtle Beach headphones before these and all 3 had the left ear break off and fabric falling apart after 6 months to a year. I've had these for around 6 months and still like brand new. Also, the design of the headstrap and how the ear cups mount to them, the breaking off seems like it will not happen.Only gripe I have is that my Xbox pair loses pairing once in a while (usually find this out after I have already gotten comfortable) and I have to repair them. This only takes a few seconds and I have no idea why it does it.But I'm not docking a star for this, they are good, give them a try.",

    "reviewText": "I like Rig headsets, their durable and comfortable. They also give great sound quality. My old one recently got the charger stuck in it causing me to buy a new one. This would looked great and was cheaper than the one I recently had. I ordered it and when I received it I started to set it up. However, this type of headset does not connect to consoles. In the video they show it does but they use a different usb drive. The one they send you does not come with a option to switch it to gaming. Headset still works perfectly but for pc, not my xbox. Gonna have to send it back and get a new one. Please double check that it is compatible with console before buying, big mistake I made",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Top class gaming headset and headphones as a whole",
    "reviewText": "I have a ton of headphones, earbuds, and gaming headsets. While I had so many options, I kept hearing about the Audeze Maxwell headphones and their superiority. Eventually, it became too hard to shut out the noise (no pun intended). After sitting with the Audeze Maxwell headphones for some time, I have to agree. They are top-of-the-line in my eyes by far.First of all, the design of the Audeze Maxwell headphones is A1. These are pro-level headphones. No cheap plastics are to be found anywhere. While the ear cushions and bands are easily replaceable, the cushion is very pillowy and soft with a super smooth exterior. The Audeze logo is small and discrete keeping these for looking like a 14-year-old's gaming headset. One thing I really like is that while the headset comes with a boom mic, it also has a mic on the headset itself allowing you to communicate without the boom mic sticking out from the headset.The depth of audio on these headphones is crazy. If you buy the Xbox set, it comes with a Dolby Atmos license, but if you buy the Playstation/PC version as I did, you can still purchase a Dolby license. I've used these headphones via USB dongle and Bluetooth. Via USB dongle on my Playstation and PC...the sound was phenomenal. These headphones put you there in the scene. Whether that's walking around Night City in a game like Cyberpunk 2077, shooting it out in a Battlefield title, or Apex Legends. Footsteps are clearly defined, and explosions and gunshots are crisp. I've had a lot of these other top gaming headsets and these are superior. While there is no noise cancellation, the job the ear cushions do of isolating you in the audio is incredible.Then I listened to music via Bluetooth on my phone. These headphones put my top-end high-priced audio headphones to shame. While the bass isn't overpowering, you feel it. voices are clear. When the music you're listening to is mixed well, these headphones will take you to a whole other place.I'll be honest, I haven't used the boom mic on these headphones much, and that's because I largely haven't had to. The mic on the headset does a good job of picking up my voice. As for the noise filter, everyone I've talked to via this headset, either on the phone or in-game/party chats has said they don't hear much background noise.Let me not forget to mention the insane battery life these headphones provide. Rated as 80 hours by Audeze, honestly in my experience I never go that many hours straight without charging, but I feel like I've gone forever without charging them, and I've never had a low battery.My experience with these headphones has made them my go-to top-of-the-line everything headphones. I get it, they aren't cheap. For what you get, they aren't expensive either. I've spent far more on headphones just for media, and these headphones not only outperform them their but also perform as my top-rated gaming headphones. I strongly recommend these for anyone looking for a new pair of headphones regardless of what the use reason is.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing at first, then phenomenal when adjusted",
    "reviewText": "First of all, I am tired of earbuds you have to constantly push into your ears to get bass and good sound, so I went with over-ear headphones again.Out of the box the Maxwell's sound neutral and nothing special. Using the Maxwell app and making adjustments make these awesome. Bass is the deepest I have ever heard in earphones, but it is not punchy bass like my old Sony XM4's. The problem with XM4's, which is also an amazing headset, is that they were not loud enough. And when you boost the gain, the distortion was unbearable. The Maxwell's cured this. I usually have them at 80% loudness. They are loud, sound great, and sound good on everything. My XM4's sounded the best with music, but below par with games and tv.Important note: It is connected to my computer with the USB-C dongle (make sure to flip the little switch on the dongle to either pc/ps5). Sometimes the Maxwell app does not recognize the headphones, so I ended up finding the most recent app on google and not the website which fixed it.FYI: I completely turn off sidetones (I do not like it; it seems like it is super sensitive to sounds around you. In the Maxwell app go to 'preset 1' to customize your equalizer. Also, in Windows sound settings, I tweaked it for higher frequency and turned on spatial sound. I am no audiophile, but it seemed to make a noticeable difference to me. I think you have to break them in to, so they will sound better when broken in.It definitely improved my game. I hear footsteps and directional sounds I never did before. People complain that they are too big or too heavy (which they are), but I have had them on for more than 8 hours straight and they were plenty comfortable for me....been two weeks now and putting in an update. I ended using the Nahimic equalizer (comes with most motherboards) and also the Audeze equalizer at the same time. I got good punchy bass now with certain songs like hip-hop or dance. These headphones are fantastic and when you adjust the sound to your taste, they are awesome....update number 2. Definitely has a break in period. I use them a lot and the sound is even better now that it has been four weeks or so. The bass literally vibrates my ears when jacked up. I ended up deleting Nahimic and using a free equalizer called fxsound instead. I like fxsound more and is super easy to use, and it has tons of presets to experiment.Soundstage is great on anything that uses stereo on TV/Movies/and especially Music. Games I find that it mainly depends on the game. Destiny 2 I find the sound stage quite poor, but the headphones still sound great. Now, Insurgency Sandstorm soundstage is excellent. I hear exactly where they are coming from. Anyway, have fun.These are made for indoor use and being in \"couch Potatoe\" mode. If you want them for exercising or working outside, then NO way. They do not clamp on your head hard enough for heavy activity and are so big they look silly in public. Personally, I got different headphones for that.",

    "reviewText": "Very, very good headset. Basically, it's 2-in-1 for enthusiasts: both a gaming headset and high-end headphones for music. Wireless at that! Nothing comes close at this price point among wireless headphones. The microphone is also very good, although hardware noise-canceling can make things sound bad if there is another layer of noise-canceling somewhere (like in Discord, for example). But that can be solved by disabling all other noise cancellations. Battery life is also huge. EQ profiles are stored on the headphones too. It's a miracle that someone decided to release this kind of thing at this price point.But there are caveats. 3 of them:1) the price. Which is kinda expected. This headset basically shoots way over its price category.2) the weight. It's ok for me and my use case, but a lot of people won't be able to use them due to them weighing so much.3) planar drivers. They are very delicate. It's the issue of this technology itself. It's very easy to damage them. And by saying easy I mean it. If you don't understand the implications of that, it's better to go for something else.",

    "reviewText": "A ver... la realidad es que hay mejores opciones para gaming y música, pero necesitas mayor presupuesto, si no lo tienes, se agradecen este tipo de soluciones todo en uno, principalmente la versión de Xbox porque lo puedes usar también en PS5 sin el audio 3D claro está, eso si, tanto para gaming, como para música requieres utilizar su EQ.Ahora bien, por qué digo que no vale la pena (y menos si tienes cabeza grande), los primeros 3 puntos son los más importantes para mi, los siguientes 3 son menores, pero si influyen:1. Demasiado pesado, desde que lo sostienes en tus manos te das cuenta, por lo mismo, no es opción para usarlo más de 1 hora2. Su doble diadema es un dolor de cabeza literalmente, la diadema externa tiene cero acolchonamiento y tiene como un \"filo\" que va de bocina a bocina casi por en medio (OJO a este \"filo\"), la diadema interna realmente está de adorno, si tienes cabeza grande tienes que ajustarla al nivel máximo, esto hace que las dos diademas queden juntas, recuerdan el filo que mencioné de la diadema externa? Después de unos 15-20 minutos sientes como se te clava este \"filo\" en la parte superior de la cabeza, bien pudieron usar la típica diadema retractil con buen acolchonamiento3. Las almohadillas generan mucho calor que tarde o temprano te hacen sudar las orejas y por si no fuera poco, se aplastan demasiado al grado de que tus orejas tocan las bocinas y después de un rato te empiezan a lastimar4. No entiendo por qué si los conectas vía auxiliar tienes que encenderlos, hay otros audífonos bluetooth con micrófono y entrada auxiliar que no requieren de encenderse para funcionar vía auxiliar5. Cada que los enciendes tienes que volver a ajustar el volumen, se supone que tienen batería, entonces, no entiendo por qué cosas tan sencillas no se almacenan en memoria6. Las perillas del volumen y mezclador son muy sensibles a la presión, muchas veces las presionas cuando sólo quieres girarlasRespecto a puntos 2 y 3, he visto reviews donde dicen que puedes comprar una diadema interna y almohadillas que resuelven el problema de la comodidad y sudor, pero estamos hablando que le estás agregando entre $2,000 (MXN) y $4,000 (MXN) extra a un headset por el cual estás pagando mínimo $6,000 (MXN), en gran medida es por esto que digo que hay mejores opciones/soluciones, mejor junta unos $10,000 (MXN) y te puedes armar un setup \"económico\" de DAC/AMP, audífonos y mic que va a resultar muchísimo mejor en todos aspectos que este headset",

    "reviewText": "I came from the senhieser momentum 3s. These guys I’d say are 3-5 times better sounding. They are 200 grams heavier than my old headset but are comfier to wear. I do feel the additional weight after ~6 hours of use. But I’m sure will go away as I use this daily and my neck gets used to it. I love the features. The range is GREAT I go anywhere in my house with perfect connectivity. I did have to move the dongle to a port on a less restricted port ( back to from port ). I haven’t had to charge them yet so I guess the battery is great !! Music sounds incredible, I take the microphone off when I listen in bed but put on for gaming. I paid 450$ cad all in all for this. I believe this product is extremely fairly priced for what you get. They take a little bit to get used to but once you do they are quite a pleasure. I have no issue believing these will last for a long time. There are also many updates to software which is nice to see. There was a French review that when I translated it called headsets “helmets” but I can’t help but think of these as my helmet hetset. There huge. But comfortable, they really hide it in the design. I’m impressed and am happy audeze made a high quality headset with a fair price. I believe this is the new gold standard for wireless music/gaming headsets",

    "reviewText": "PLEASE READ EDIT AT THE END.Do not purchase from this seller. Multiple issues with this item. Though the box came damaged, I was still hopeful. Upon opening it was apparent the box had been not only opened, but the item used. It is advertised as new, not used. The LED bar meant to signal battery percentage and charging status was broken upon receiving. The charging station also does a very poor job of charging and causes issues with the port on the controller. After over 18 hours of charging the controller wasn’t even charged to 50%. The only aspects of this product that works as advertised are the light at the base of the charging tower and the hanging stand for the headset. Very disappointing purchase.EDIT:After my review was accepted and submitted, the seller reached out apologizing and offered a full refund or free replacement as a solution. Their customer service was excellent, very fast responses and friendly. I received my refund in less than 24 hours. I would consider purchasing from this seller in the future and I do recommend purchasing from them. My issues are resolved!",

Today when I set my controller on it the lights in the bar went absolutely insane. I didn’t think much about it and was gone all day. I came back to my controller not charged and the lights still going crazy. I took it off the charger and the lights work fine. I put my controller on it and crazy lights… my phone won’t even charge anymore when plugged into it. Really annoyed, and will be contacting customer service.Update: I got in contact with the company who makes these and they sent me a new one free of charge… I’ve had it 24/hours and it’s working okay. It’s a little wonky when I set my controller down it freaks out but after about 5 minutes it works like normal.. I will give it some more time before I change my review completely or keep it the same. It was nice if the company to send me a new one though.",

I told myself when my latest headset breaks (RAZOR KITTY) I’ll buy my friends headset and that’s just what I did.. my goodness it’s the best headset I’ve had. Ever. My voice is clear and the audio is amazing. I assumed all low price headsets were scams but here’s this one.. amazing value.

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Pro's & Cons between Sony In Zone H9 Wireless Headset to the Sony Pulse 3D Wireless Headset",
    "reviewText": "I'm currently using the Sony In Zone H9 Wireless Headset with my PlayStation 5 via USB dongle (2.4 Ghz) and paired up to my Android phone via (Bluetooth).I own two pairs of Pulse 3D wireless headsets (Black & White) both are still working in perfect condition to compare this written comparison review.I bought the H9's to see if my gaming experience would be better compared to the Pulse 3D headset.Here's the pros and cons for the H9's comparing it to the Pulse 3D wireless headset.Pros:• H9's are very comfortable. H9's don't squeeze your head as much as the Pulse 3D's. Very little difference between the two but slightly noticable comfort.• H9's feels lighter on my head. Both are pretty light weight headsets. Most likely this is from the bigger ear cups on the H9's.• Both are Glasses friendly headsets.• Both use USB-C to charge the headsets.• Both have easy volume controls on the left ear cup. H9's has a volume wheel for adjusting the overall sound which is more user friendly compared to the up and down separate volume buttons on the Pulse 3D headset.• Both are able to adjust the game volume and voice chat volume independently. (This is a huge pro for when playing online with friends.) H9's button's are on the right ear cup. Pulse 3D's are on the left.• Noise Cancelation on the H9's is the true seller for me. It's really good. By far the best feature to have on a gaming headset. Turning the Noise Cancelation On is as easy as pressing a single button on your left ear cup to adjust the level of noise around you. When I turn on the noise cancelation to max I can't even hear my window air-conditioner any more. Which was a distraction from my gaming experience.• Microphone quality sounds allot better as what my PSN friends say.• H9's are easier to rest around your neck because the ear cups fold in towards your chest. Pulse 3D's ear cups don't fold or move at all.• H9's are able to pair a Bluetooth device while gaming on the PlayStation 5. For example I can listen to music or answer phone calls from my Smartphone all while I can still hear the game and chat audio from the PlayStation 5. Tip: Best way if you're needing to focus on your phone call press and hold the mute button on your DualSense Controller to kill the voice chat and game chat audio from the PS5.• The Sound quality from the H9 headset has better Highs and Better Lows. I ran several tests with this headset both bass sound tests and vocal sound tests. Overall the sound quality of these internal speaker's in the H9's are a improvement compared to the Pulse 3D. Both headsets have really good sound for gaming.Cons:• The Price between the two is a $200 difference. Pulse 3D is $99 and the H9's are $299.• Can't mute the microphone with the DualSense Controller. (The Pulse 3D Wireless Headset also can't mute the microphone from the DualSense Controller unless you use the 3.5 mm headphone jack to the DualSense Controller. This is a minor complaint but logically it makes sense to use the most quickest way to mute yourself for thing's like coughing or sneezing. The DualSense Controller mute button is the quickest button that's near your hands while gaming. This is a major oversight for the PS5's firmware/hardware. Pro Tip: to mute yourself on the H9's you just flip up the boom microphone on the left ear cup until you hear a click or see the microphone is muted on the TV. With the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset you have to press the Mute button on the left ear cup.• If you're standing or sitting down and you bend over 45° and look straight downward to the floor the H9's slowly start to slide off your head. Pulse squeeze's your head slightly more so the headset doesn't slide off your head as fast. Nothing to be major concerned about because you typically look forward while play games.• H9's don't have a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Pulse 3D headset does.• H9's don't currently have a EQ option to adjust on the PlayStation 5 compared to the Pulse 3D.Overall I'm impressed with the H9's. My only major complaint is the price and the lack of EQ settings on the PlayStation 5. Both issues could be resolved overtime. So if you're looking for a gaming headset and want good quality sound and the ability to cut out sounds around you while you're playing a video game I'd strongly recommend the H9's.If you're not wanting noise cancelation and are on a budget I'd recommend the Pulse 3D headset.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Review after one year",
    "reviewText": "I've been through a lot of gaming headsets over the years and after a year of using the H9s they are easily the best ones I have used. First off, as someone who mostly plays on Playstation they integrate perfectly. You get all of the UI features you'd expect from a first party product which immediately feels better than other third party brands. PC performance is good but not really noteworthy in any way, they sound great, they work fine. There is an app that you can use on windows but in my opinion it's useless. The default sound profile is much better than anything I could come up with on my own. Bluetooth is also really nice to have. You can listen to music or take calls while playing games easilyOne of the best things about it is just how comfortable they are. I've found most gaming headsets uncomfortable after extended use but I could wear the H9s all day without any discomfort other them getting a little warm in the summer. Of the dozen or so gaming headsets I've used, nothing else comes close to being as comfortable as the H9s.The default sound profile is pretty balanced. If you are a huge bass junkie something from Turtle Beach or logitech might be a better choice, but for me there is plenty of bass on the H9s. You can crank it up in the app but it just doesn't sound very good. Noise cancelling is also very solid. The easiest headphones I'd compare them to is the Sony XM4 or XM5. I think both the sound and noise cancelling is slightly better on ths headphones, but the H9s are very close to as good.Cons:the price is steep, but I think it's understandable when you look at comparable headphones.They run a bit large. I think a child would have trouble wearing them so keep that in mindThe automatic turn off doesn't seem to recognize PS5 rest mode as being \"turned off\" meaning that if I forget to manually turn them off I'll often come back the next day to a mostly dead battery. Seems like a frustrating oversight on Sony's part. Expect to turn them off manually each time. If you are only using them on PC the auto turn off function seems fine. This is probably the biggest downside to them.Also, these go on sale regularly and it's not hard to find them for around half off either from a sale or refurb. I found mine for $140 and have friends that also got them for that cheap.Overall I'd highly recommend.",

    "reviewTitle": "A Well-Rounded Gaming Companion",
    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Sony INZONE H9 headset and here’s my breakdown:**Pros:**1. **Impressive Sound Quality:** Boasting a well-balanced profile with thumpy bass, the audio immersion is top-notch.2. **Effortless Connectivity:** Simultaneous Bluetooth and dongle connection with minimal delay, facilitating seamless communication on Discord or multitasking with a connected phone during PS5 gaming.3. **Decent Mic Performance:** While not exceptional, the mic captures clear voice without picking up ambient noises, comparable to the quality of Sennheiser Game One's.4. **Effective Noise Cancelling:** Competing closely with the renowned Apple AirPods Max, the ANC capabilities are nearly on par, providing a serene gaming atmosphere.5. **Exceptional Comfort:** Especially catering to glasses wearers, the H9 excels in comfort during extended gaming sessions, surpassing the clamping force issues experienced with the AirPods Max.6. **Featherlight Design:** The headset's lightweight construction adds to the comfort, making it feel surprisingly weightless during use.**Cons:**1. **Build Material Concerns:** The lightweight design comes at the expense of a somewhat flimsy plastic chassis, raising durability concerns, particularly in the event of accidental drops.2. **Software Hiccups:** The Sony INZONE hub software requires refinement, as firmware updates may lead to disconnections around the 80% mark. However, with a hard reset and meticulous software uninstallation, issues can be resolved.**Value for Money:**Purchased at a discounted price of $269 CAD (down from $399), the INZONE H9 proves to be a worthwhile investment, although the original price may seem a tad high.**Conclusion:**Overall, the Sony INZONE H9 stands out as a commendable gaming headset, excelling in sound quality, comfort, and versatility. While some concerns exist with build materials and software, the headset's performance, especially at the discounted price, makes it a satisfying purchase for gamers seeking a reliable and immersive audio experience.",

    "reviewText": "The product came exactly as pictured. You may be offput by the lack of a built-in head cushion, however, the \"self-adjusting\" cushion seriously works better than the traditional built-in head cushions. It stretches to fit just about any head size/shape. I have a rather long and large head. so finding OTE headphones that don't feel like my head is in a vise grip is challenging, but RIG came through with the cushions on this rig!I wore them for a solid 4-6hrs and there were points where I almost forgot I was wearing them because of how soft the ear cushions are.The inclusion of a splitter jack and a minimal, detachable and foldable microphone displays excellent consumer knowledge and insight as this headset can maintain the same level of functionality out in the wild as it can at home without any hassle.If you're looking for a budget AND quality headset, THIS is the one. I'd give it 5 more stars if I could.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this back in the end of February, opened it and used it a few times. Only for listening though. To which this headset has very good sound and clarity. Its also very comfortable for being on the bottom tier of gaming headsets.Unfortunately I never ended up using the microphone which is a plug in until about a month later. Come to find out it was dead or the connection to the 3.5mm jack is bad. Have not been able to determine which it is. Sadly its now just a nice headset for listening to music. My Rub here was that I tried to ask for a replacement, not a refund and I'm 3 days past the return date. While that is mostly on me for not checking this sooner, something like this that was purchased relatively recently should have still been able to be replaced since a major component was defective.",

    "reviewText": "On the 3D front, I don't know what I expected for such an inexpensive device that has no head tracking, but I was still disappointed by the Dolby Atmos demos: \"You can tell where the sound is with pinpoint accuracy!\" Um, no, it still sounds like it's in my head; I can barely tell the difference between this and the stereo headphones of yesteryear.That's disappointing but not a deal breaker at that price. But the microphone not working is a real problem.The microphone wouldn't pick up my voice with any real volume on my Windows 11 Samsung laptop (I'd shout and the test would say my volume was at 4%), and yes I tried all the usual troubleshooting steps, made sure the mute mic button was off, made sure the sound gain was at max in the settings menu, etc.",

    "reviewText": "The fist thing I noticed about this Gaming Headset was that it was feather light, but neither looked nor felt cheap. The headband is molded out of strong, flexible and light plastic, with an high-tech design. The ear cups are adjustable to three heights. For the price, the speakers sound pristine on the highs and rock bottom on the low frequencies. The ear-pads are made out of cloth covered, soft and airy foam. They let a fair degree of sound in, which I like, so I can hear my roommate talking or the phone ringing while playing, and I like this. The head-strap fits snugly, giving these headsets a solid feel. The mic-boom is removable. I would have liked a mic that tucked away instead; only because I feel I might lose track of the mic. Over-all, the fit and finish of this product, is pure quality. My only other negative comment I have is that oval ear-cups would have fit my big ears better.I purchased the Plantronics RIG 400 because I did need a new Gaming Headset, but mostly for the included Dolby Atmos access code, which came bundled with it. I immediately fell in love with Dolby Atmos, when I sampled Dolby Access for the Xbox One. The layers of sound was truly impressive and I just had to subscribe to the service.",

I didn't receive a backing for my controller \"the thing that holds the batteries in\". Very disappointing and I would not recommend doing buisness with this company ever. Pretty much sold me a $20.

Now, two things I didn't like, and I had to make a little adjustment: 1) Surprisingly, it came with the 3 color connectors which brings back memories when I played GameCube, N64, PS1, you name it, but my TV doesn't support it, I mean nowdays most TV's and consoles have HDMI ports now, so luckily i had an HDMI chord laying around somewhere, I used it. 2) the controller, specifically the left stick, so when I started playing games, it rotates fine, it doesn't lay on one side, but when you press it down, it doesn't work and I tried it few times. So for some games, I had to go to Options and picked a different buttons layout that I'm more comfortable with and practice few times until I get good as I was.",

    "reviewText": "I've bought this 360 as a backup to my original I've owned for the better part of 15 years, especially in light of the looming shutdown of XBLA. On the outside the console looks excellently maintained and well kept, however booting up the console the system loads into the OS version from 2011. This on the surface was not an issue, however the system would not update from the internet nor accept either of my XBL accounts for console or PC. This is not an unheard of issue and so I burned the updates from 2019 onto a disc and copied them onto a hard drive if the former did not work. The console would begin the updates from the flash drive only to still give the same response as downloading from the internet. After perusing forums and trying multiple ways for two days after work, the general support issue I've found is that this is a common problem with improperly formatted or set up replacement parts. I may not be able to confirm this due to me not wanting to damage the console but the system cannot even play Dragon Age Origins or create a new profile without demanding an update that crashes it or forces you back to the dashboard. This is not a 360 Slim issue, as my other 360 is an identical model save for some stickers and minor finish blemishes from more than a decade of taking the console to friend's houses. Moreover it also started effectively with the same version of the OS. If you want an Xbox 360 I'd implore you to look for one at your local video game store which unless I can repair this one is likely where I'll be trading it for a working one, unfortunately.",

    "reviewText": "As much as I would love to have a real Cow hide table runner, it just isn’t something that is available for multiple reasons. Mostly because of financial reasons. So when I saw this Linen Cow print table runner, I thought that this was a great idea.For one thing, it would be super expensive for us to secure a real cowhide. I thought that I should try this Linen table runner and see if it would look nice enough to keep on display in our home. The length of the table runner is 13” X 71”, and has Cowhide print over the entire length of the table runner. I was able to choose from a black or a brown cowhide print, and I thought that the brown cowhide was best for our home. Both looked beautiful.As good as it looks on our buffet, it is missing a few of the qualities that I would most prefer. For one, I know that this is just a print, but I wish that the fabric was a bit thicker. I know that it isn’t possible for the print to have more depth, or a tactile texture to it, but the table runner is just missing that main part of what would make it spectacular. I have seen faux fur table runners and I wasn’t impressed with them at all. I do think that if you want the look of cowhide, this is probably the best route to go. Whether I get absolutely everything that I want or not.When you see the table runner in my pictures, it really looks amazing. The table runners look amazing on the manufacturer’s site as well. And although it is an amazing look, it’s not quite making it as a replacement for the real thing. I personally don’t know if there is even a way to make this style of print any better.I want to say that the tailoring is excellent. The print is excellent. It’s a great length. The pricing is excellent, for a print. It’s easy to clean, and to maintain. Certainly a lot easier to take care of than a real cowhide. With everything that I have written, I can tell that I really like the Linen Cow table runner.",

Just make sure once you put them down, to not pick them back up, because they curl a little. Which a little heat on it to put it back down helps. But I like these and the wedding couple loved how the tables turned out. People thought they were real until they sat down. I would definitely buy them again when I need to. Thank you.",

There made of good enough material, easy to wash strong enough that they won’t bend and fold if you’re careful with them. If I had bought them at Walmart. I would probably return them. But I don’t believe it to be the Sellers problem. I’m sure that they provided measurements and I just didn’t pay attention because I thought they were so cute.",

I'm the only one using and, therefore, cleaning them and haven't have occasion to use all of them. I guess I'm old enough to expect quality products from companies that had the reputation for quality products and expecting them to stand behind what they sell. Silly me.",

    "reviewText": "Die Untersetzer sind, wie von Pimpernel gewohnt, sehr gut verarbeitet - man findet keine scharfen Kanten oder sonstige Unsauberkeiten. Die Größe reicht völlig für Glas, Besteck und die meisten Teller (bei größeren Tellern, z.B. Pizzatellern, hat ein Glas keinen Platz mehr), und auch mit heißen Gegenständen bleiben die Tischsets formstabil. Die Oberfläche ist außerdem recht unempfindlich gegen Kratzer.So weit so gut. Leider finde ich jedoch das Midnight Slate Motiv ziemlich enttäuschend. Was auf dem Produktbild klar und dunkel wirkt kommt in Wirklichkeit sehr blass und unscharf daher. Es wirkt so, als würde man das Motiv durch eine satinierte Glasscheibe betrachten. Das kann Pimpernel definitiv besser - beim 'Parisian Scenes' beispielsweise ist das Motiv klar und deutlich.",

    "reviewText": "I use toothpicks a lot for hobbies - for applying different glues, as a holder for parts to paint, modifying them for miniature sanding, etc. Before using this little gem I tried many different methods . Having a box of 500 on my bench didn't work....the box was large and took up valuable bench space, the box started falling part and trying to dig out one toothpick with my sausage fingers never worked! I tried putting some toothpicks in a tall shot glass, but that kept getting knocked over spilling the toothpicks everywhere. Then I switched to a salt shaker type dispenser, which actually wasn't that bad. The biggest downside is that you have to grab it, turn it over and shake it to release a toothpick, but sometimes a couple extra would fly out. Then I saw this dispenser and decided to give it a try....and it works amazingly well! Just press the button and one toothpick pops up ready to use...no more, no less! The toothpick pops up high enough to grab easily, it holds a good qty and takes up no more space than the previous dispenser! Highly recommended if you're looking for a good quality dispenser that works well!",

It's plastic so well see how long it lasts but for the cost, this wasn't a horrible impulse purchase.",

Battery seems to last, though I've never used it so long I had to stop to charge. It isn't scratched up or abused, but it's not new either. It just works well.On thing. The screen is small, and the edges take up space leaving less real estate for the content. It's better than a phone or small tablet, but a laptop it ain't. I love that the screen is touch, so I can type on keyboard and just use finger to go back or scroll or correct. My old tablet with keyboard couldn't do that.Great value. I'll let you know about charging times and battery life over longer term use.M",

This is a great Chromebook for all our basic needs. I use mine on flights to get some work done. I really like the tent/tablet mode for watching videos. Some of my favorite apps are also available on this Chromebook. The seller is very good to work with and I just ordered one more for my daughter. The quality is what you would expect for a used educational edition Chromebook. Some buyers expect that theirs will be flawless. So far on all of mine the screen has been scratch free. Once I get them I clean them really well and even put a coat of armor all on the housing to shine it back up. Both of the Chromebooks I have received have been in excellent condition and fully functional. These things have 4gb of ram and a roughly 2.5ghz quad core processor, so apps run very smooth. Video quality is great, but I'm not sure what resolution the screen is. I recommend the 500e to anyone looking for a cheap Chromebook suitable for browsing, watching videos, and playing the occasional games.",

    "reviewText": "I have ordered 3 of these. The first one I ordered looked in very good condition, and worked well but stopped working after about a month, and due to a problem with my Amazon account I can no longer access it to make a return (have to use husband's account now). I then ordered 2 more, and when they came I realized that my 1st order hadn't even been the correct item! Only 1 of the 3 was actually a 2nd gen!!! These last 2 came in pretty bad physical condition. I bought it renewed in excellent condition, which should be close to new looking. Faaaaaar from it! I'm keeping the one that is actually the correct product, because (so far) it's working correctly. I'm putting a case over it, so the scratches all over won't be a big deal. What IS a big deal is the other one that came. Not only was it not a 2nd generation, as ordered, and it was extremely worn and scratched all over (even the keys had heavy wear) but it is even CRACKED on one corner, and the glass screen is popping out on that corner, too! This company is doing a terrible job, and I'm returning the worst of the last 2 as soon as I can. I'm hesitant to ask for a replacement because who knows what I'll receive this time. My expectations aren't as high as most. All I wanted was for them to be the correct item, not look like they've been thrown on concrete over and over, and work properly. Sadly, they can't even live up to this, despite selling these claiming they've been renewed to excellent.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Great Product! Deceptive Product Page!!",
    "reviewText": "First the good: I received my Chromebook in excellent condition! Considering its age, it looked like new and has great performance. Not one scratch or blemish on it. 2 in 1 touch screen works perfectly. No issues with hinges when placing it in tablet mode. All keys worked. Not mentioned on product page is that it had 4 ports (2 USB C style and 2 older style) and a micro SD slot. All of which work fine. Now the bad and my only complaint: The product page list this Chromebook as being released on 6/16/2022. I purchased this Chromebook based on this information. When I first turned it on, I checked through OS settings and saw that the Auto Update Expiration date is 6/2027. Only 3 years from now. Upon further investigation, I found out that this device was released in 6/2018. IMO, This is very DECEPTIVE!! I purchased this item based on the listed release date on the product page. If I had known it was 2018, I would have purchased a newer, i.e., 2020, renewed Chromebook I saw out there. Lesson learned for me. I would have given this product 5 stars, it really is in excellent condition, but due to the deception, I am knocking it down to 3, and debating whether to keep it or return it. I also wasn’t pleased that a few hours after ordering the Chromebook, all of a sudden it was around $10 cheaper than what I paid for it. Then the next day it was back to around what I paid for it.If you are OK with a Chromebook that will receive OS updates for only 3 more years, then by all means purchase this one. New Chromebooks with 2 in 1 screens are not cheap. The one I received really is in great condition. Maybe I’ll just buy a used one every 3 years.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love my laptop - with a longer battery and less finicky mouse, this would be a perfect machine!",
    "reviewText": "Before buying this laptop, I first purchased an HP flip screen laptop from Target. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I knew there had to be something better on the market!I tried my luck on this laptop and immediately fell in love. While the prices were similar, the level of quality felt incomparable. Visuals on the screen are decent quality, and the touch screen is perfect. It's compatible with multiple styluses and works beautifully for drawing and sketching.The keyboard is not back-lit, but the keys are decent enough for the price point. I use a Macbook Pro for work, and you should not expect this machine to act like that type of workhorse. Even just after sleeping for a day or two with programs running this little guy requires a restart. However, I feel perfectly satisfied with the product I received for this price point.There are only two opportunities with this laptop:* Battery Life - while at first this easily went a full week without requiring a charge, it's now beginning to need one every 4-5 days. I'm a little leery that it's losing power after about six weeks of solid use - but since I only use it at home, it's rarely an issue.* Built-in mouse - this mouse is kind of crappy. I use a trackpad for my job every day and find this unit incredibly finicky. It leaps, it skips, it jumps - it is not steady and takes me longer to click to where I'm going as a result. I largely use my laptop on my couch, but if I were working or studying I'd definitely recommend an external mouse.That said - for this price point, you're not going to get perfection. What you ARE going to get is a VERY decent computer that can surf the web, type emails, novels, what have you, and offer a very solid solution for drawing when you want to mix things up a bit.",

    "reviewText": "After carefully combing through all the reviews of this PC, some good some bad, some people were saying that they got the absolute base model no battery I still chose to go with this vendor because of their feedback and their positivity. I’m glad I did because when I open the box 3 days early ahead of schedule, I was quite surprised, this thing is an excellent condition you can’t even tell it’s ever been used it’s faster than my HP that has windows 11 on it. It does not have the backlit keyboard but my girlfriend noticed by accident that’s fully touchscreen. I wasn’t expecting to get a touchscreen one that’s crazy , if you’re on the fence about dropping $200 don’t hesitate this thing is worth more than 200. I would pay it again if I had to just have this computer I’ve been wanting to upgrade for a while as my HP is old and tired I couldn’t be happier with my purchase , I just might end up buying a second one mine also came with a new battery and a brand new OEM charger.",

Now a couple months in (after the return trial is over) it's acting up so much it's completely useless. It toggles between different windows, pulls up new applications and skips around the screen all on its own. It's as if 6 children each have their own mouse and are all controlling my laptop at once. It was a waste of money. I wish I either invested in a new one or held off on buying a laptop all together. Don't make my mistake, avoid this vendor.",

    "reviewText": "I love this laptop. For 200 this is a steal, I really didn't even know it was touch screen until a month later and it made me love it even more. The touch screen only uses your actual fingers and not a digital pen, this is not a tablet. I use it as an additional laptop to my main one. Basically, I use this laptop for school going from class to class because A) its light, B) If it gets stolen it was only 200 c) The specs are good for its price. I am a junior physics major who uses it for coding, school work, and circuitry. The only downside is that you would need to change the battery(Dont have to change it at first, still works with what was given but you would get more life if changed). But really compared to the other options this I found was the best after weeks of research for a cheap laptop. The battery can last up to around 2 hrs 20 min Id say if put on lowest performance. It works fine if you have it connected to its charger(Usb C), which most classes have. Good space if you only use it for school work, Have not tried gaming on it other than chess.com mainly because I have a better pc for that. Would highly recommend it if you are on a budget. Runs windows also.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good purchase if you know what you are buying for!",
    "reviewText": "This laptop works well so far. Just docking off half a point for the absence of internal battery as mentioned by other reviews.I bought this laptop to give away to someone i know. Basically, decided on this laptop considering the upgradeability factor and also from experience of using this model as my work machine.The packging was good and the refurbished information came with it as well. The windows activation was a breeze. The front lid of the machine came with a matte sticker finish to possibly hide any previous usage blemishes.I've done a couple upgrades so far. The laptop came with a 256GB SSD albeit a 2.5 inch SATA model. I've upgraded this to a SK Hynix P31 Gold 1TB NVME. I had to buy a 2.5 inch SATA to NVME bay to accomplish this.I've also updated the Wifi controller. It came with a 8265NGW chip. I've upgraded this to Intel AX210NGW. This will support Wifi 6/6E and Bluetooth 5.2/5.3. I've tested this and noticed definite speed increase on the wifi connection. I needed to download the Intel drivers for Bluetooth and Wifi beforehand and install the drivers after installing the new chip. If you are familiar with changing M2 type drives it will be a similar process along with plugging in some antenna connections.Finally, recommend downloading Lenovo Vantage from Microsoft app store and doing all the necessary system updates along with updating the Thunderbolt 3 firmware as T480 is known to have issues with Thunderbolt 3 with old firmware.",

    "reviewText": "This is a great alternative to a cheap budget laptop. It was a top-end business laptop circa 2018 and it still is top quality. One nice feature is that it has two batteries, one of which is user replaceable without tools. I bought this because I was tired of cheap laptops breaking on me and having compatibility issues with my docking station. This works well with a dual monitor setup (with purchase of external Thunderbolt 3 dock), and is built tough. It is not \"a thin and light\" computer, but it is great for around the house, video calls, movies, and office applications, plus occasional travel.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased a refurbished Thinkpad T480 from Microbeeglobal on Amazon, but unfortunately, the device was faulty and stopped working after only a few months of real use (less than 6 months). The charging port + Thunderbolt port were both dead (buying a new one plus motherboard soldering is not a DIY fix). I would not recommend buying from this seller, as my experience was less than satisfactory. Upon receiving my device, it looked clean with no scratches, but some parts and folds had dust. The internal (main) battery was not reliable since day one, but the extended one worked fine (48WH one). When I contacted the support team, they confirmed that it was a motherboard issue and that it was hard to fix by myself. I am past Amazon’s 90-day return window, and the seller’s support team suggested returning or replacing the device but stopped answering afterwards. Although the support team was friendly, it was difficult to get my message through, and some of the emails had Chinese words. I later found out that the team works from UAE",

    "reviewText": "This is hands-down the best laptop I have ever owned!! My boyfriend has a model a few years older than this one and it always works beautifully for him, so I decided to get one for myself after much contemplation and research. I have had this laptop for over a month and I use it heavily on a near-daily basis for taking notes, reading online textbooks, web browsing, writing papers, etc. I don't play video games and I don't have a lot of pictures or music I store on my hard drive, so this is perfect for me. I would highly recommend this computer to those in school and/or those who mainly use their laptops for web browsing and Microsoft Office uses. The smaller screen doesn't bother me at all, but some folks might have an issue with it - just something to be aware of if you're looking for/needing something with a larger screen.The touchscreen works beautifully. It boots up quickly every time I open it, and even with the 4GB of RAM preinstalled, it can handle all of my tabs and programs open (I plan to expand it to 8GB soon). The only \"complaint\" I have is its battery life. It's decent, much better than that of the ASUS I had before, but I bought this computer refurbished, so maybe in a year or so I'll replace the battery. Still, for the low price and all of the features, durability, convenience, and reliability, this is one hell of a deal! I am a very happy customer! Lenovo is the only brand I will ever buy!!",

This is a refurbished unit but it looks brand new. Very nice! Arrived quickly and was packaged really well.The battery life, as noted in the reviews, is short, but I keep mine plugged in most of the time when I'm at home, anyway.I want to turn off the touchpad but it looks like it's unnecessarily complicated. My old laptop had a key for it, but this one requires many steps.Only two usb ports but it says they're both 3.0, so that's good.The FN button is where the Ctrl button normally is, so I keep hitting the wrong button. I suppose I'll get used to that.This is more like a notebook than a laptop, though it works the same, which is what I want, but with only 128 gb I'm already out of room. I hadn't counted on that. Looks like I'll be using the cloud or a flash drive now, and will have to figure out which is best for me. I'm used to having tons of room on a laptop so this will take some getting used to, too.It's heavier than I expected, considering there is no hard drive and no disk player.I've only had it for a few days, so if I find anything else I'll come back and update.",

    "reviewText": "This met my expectations for the price. I can use it for my daily writing and internet use, it's not gigantic so I can fit it in a smaller bag, and it has a very responsive touchscreen (honestly better quality than I expected for the price). It acts as a 2-1 tablet/computer, while having a much sturdier clamshell hinge than a typical tablet with a keyboard attached. It is much more comfortable to type with in my lap, and feels less delicate (less easily broken). The battery life is pretty standard and no complaints (around 5 hours).Some downsides that were not easily noticeable from viewing it online:- The 11 inch size refers to the viewing portion of the screen, which has a large border, so the actual laptop is more like 13 inches. This was mildly disappointing because I really wanted it to be as small as possible to fit in my day bag. (But it's still fairly small.)- There are no backlit keys on the keyboard.- It is a bit heavy for its size (but not unmanageable).The refurbish job was pretty good. The only issue was the trackpad seemed a little too clacky (maybe loose), but it worked perfectly.",

It states Windows 10, but it has Windows 11. Usually, I would say this would be a plus. But the Yoga 11e doesn't have the possessor or RAM to have Windows 11. The system is so slow, and the response hurts when trying to open an app or even start up.2. Sound card - 5 minutes into the start of me using this laptop/tablet, the sound goes wonky and is in slow motion sound and sounds like a robot. It's not acceptable for out of the box.3. The hinge and mismatch screws. Ok, I know this is wear and tear. But Amazon has this in excellent condition. These items should have been replaced.4. There is no tablet mode. I'm unsure if this is a Win11 thing, but you have a tablet mode on the Action Center. I use this laptop/tablet to watch streams, so I turned the keyboard over so it would stand up to watch.4.5 Well, it kind of goes with the above. When you have it in the inverted position, the keyboard is still active, and keys are being pushed. I can’t type anything without holding the machine up.Things I enjoy1. Cheap2.

Lenovo Tech was no help either. Amazon tech only helped with returning but that’s it. Bad service",

    "reviewText": "The Chromebook came as advertised with the exception that it does not have a backlit keyboard as it was listed as having. It is also completely out of it's warranty period, which was not mentioned. Overall the Chromebook is excellent. It is a little larger and heavier than I expected, but not so much that it is going to be a problem. The picture quality is excellent. As with all Chromebook's the audio quality is good, but the volume is very low. This is compounded by the speakers being on the bottom (do the people who designed this have a different way of holding a laptop where speakers on the bottom is a good listening position?) Downloading any volume boosting extension will solve the volume problem. It has a large keyboard and touch pad, and the touchscreen works well. It charges relatively quickly and the battery seems to last. I have noticed that with 100% battery, when you unplug the charger, there is a noticeable dimming of the screen, which I will have to look into. I've emailed the seller and I am waiting to hear back about the backlit keyboard and warranty. I am withholding 1 star for not having a backlit keyboard 1 for not mentioning it being out of warranty and 1 waiting to see how this is handled. I will update the rating and comments as soon as the dust settles.Update. I had a response in under 30 minutes. They apologized for the confusion and gave me the options to either return it for a full refund or they would send me $20. I took the $20 which will buy me a keyboard light. Promt, polite and offered a solution acceptable to us both. Great customer service. Changed the rating to 4 stars.I have a defacto 30 day warranty, in the return window. Lenovo has a 2 year, in home, service in 24 hours warranty I can purchase, that also covers the screen and accidental damage (if I drop it and crack the screen I'm covered) for $122.45 (plus a warranty reinstatement fee if $22). Even with a bogus reinstatement fee its a good deal. The seller, Amazon and Lenovo customer service all did a good job on this one. 2 thumbs up! 👍👍",

    "reviewText": "I needed a new Chromebook when my old one's updates expired and it started acting weird. I chose this one because the price, the reviews, the specs, and the expiration date of updates met or exceeded my minimum qualifications.PROS: I am pleased so far with almost all aspects of the machine. I still have to do a little fine-tuning with the settings but overall, I am pleased.CONS: 1. Although I was supposed to get a power cord, there was not one in the box. This was not an issue since I could use the one from my old CB.2. I hate the case. My old CB had a textured plastic case and was very easy to grip and stayed put. I have to tightly grip this smooth metal case when lifting it which creates pain in my hand. It slips around on my lap when I use it. I have to grip the corner. I finally resorted to using a small bathmat upside down to help with the stability.Bottom line: I like the machine but hate the smooth metal case.Added note: FYI: This model is supported through June 2025. When the support for my previous Chromebook ended, I planned to continue using it while I shopped for a replacement. However, the device was pretty much unusable after that date - so much garbage, pop-ups, etc. started showing up on my screen. So take that into consideration when buying this model.",

    "reviewText": "This Lenovo is my first Chromebook but umpteenth Lenovo laptop. First, I held my breath and clicked Used - Very Good from Amazon Warehouse Deals to save almost $100. Small cosmetic imperfections on sides of the item. Well, I can't see any imperfections anywhere. Couldn't tell the difference between this and a brand new machine. The laptop looks great, the large screen is awesome, the operation is snappy with the I3, no performance issues with only 4 GB RAM, I am very pleased with this machine, it fully meets my Lenovo build expectations.One thing that surprised me but shouldn't is that this machine is way heavier than our Lenovo X1 Carbon gen 4. 2.7 lbs vs 4.3 lbs. But, having the larger screen is so great and its a touch screen to boot.It is Chrome OS that causes the loss of one star. It took me 2 days to configure this machine and I've been building PCs since the late 90's. The problem I had is probably not one that most people will have. I subscribe to G Suite for Business and I guess that when it comes to Chromebooks, the Suite administration sticks its tentacles in there whether you want it or not.One major issue was that Google Play was disabled in my Chromebook (a nonstarter) with a message that said \"this is managed by your administrator\". I'm the administrator and I did not disable Google Play for any of my devices. Turns out G Suite disables Google Play by default. So just go into G Suite and enable Google Play. Not so fast, navigating G Suite is a nightmare, completely non-intuitive, at least for me. Ultimately after a day of Google searches and fruitlessly trying all kinds of switches in G Suite, a Google support person set me straight. All was fine after speaking with him.The next challenge was Microsoft Office integration. I also subscribe to Office 365. Eat another day, the MS apps would not let me sign-in with my account. Call to Microsoft support fixed that. Then the next challenge was passing files between OneDrive and Google Drive. Installing File System for Windows was the answer. Finally, I had Chrome OS configured the way I needed it to be. In 2020, it should not be this hard to get your new laptop up and running.",

I am so over & done with windows so this seemed like a nice option. It is very printer fussy. It would work with the one I had but it gave a list of printers that would. I ordered one from that list. Nope. Wouldn't work. I wanted a lighted keyboard. I didn't know that the only lighted keyboard was the touch screen one that insists on popping up constantly when I'm using the other (unlit) keyboard. I really prefer the raised keys of a keyboard over touchscreen for typing. It has some nice features. Holds a charge well. Will store your info so you don't need to enter it yourself but most computers do that. The screen size is nice. But the negatives far outweigh the positives for me. I regret the purchase.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing!",
    "reviewText": "I've only had it for 3 days now but I love everything about it so far!First of all the appearance: I love the color; it's a metallic pink that almost looks silver, but the keyboard's pink is much more noticeably pink. The letters on the keyboard itself are large and easy to read. There were a few minor scratches on the outside of mine but the inside is pristine.Moving on to sound: The keys are relatively quiet when you type on them, but the space bar is a bit too loud in my opinion. I've only used it for roughly four hours so far but I haven't heard any loud air vents coming from it.One side note I'd like to mention real quick though is that when I was setting everything up, it was really pushing me to sign up for a bunch of Microsoft related products which I found a little annoying. I prefer using Google for browsing which is completely free whereas the Microsoft stuff would have charged me after one year of usage(I believe it was a year).And finally performance: Like practically every other laptop, this one takes a minute or two to really start working properly when you initially turn it on. I've only really used it for typing so I haven't really dived into browsing the web, but I can confidently say that the keys are immediately responsive when I type anything out. I haven't had any issues with it running slow as of yet.The battery life is very good. I had it on the highest brightness while using it outside for a few hours and it only dropped to 88% where it was originally charged to 100.One final thing I'd like to mention is that I absolutely love the screen! I bought this to work on my novel outside and while I always try to work in the shade, the sun can be a little pesky, however the screen is mostly opaque and has little to no reflection - making it the perfect laptop to use outside!Anyway, if this laptop is still available to order, I highly recommend it if you plan on using it for work!",

    "reviewText": "You are PURELY the target for the Machine to HARD SELL you various so-called services.I paid a lot of money hoping to use this to take notes.I cannot do that. The MACHINE wants to HARD SELL me the ability to write a note. Then for MORE MONEY, to save my note. Then if I pay MORE MONEY, I could see my note again.I have to have all manner of secret passcodes and PIN numbers, to get to my note. With Mobi. I need an account there too.If your life is way too simple and you want to make it extremely complicated to write \"The cat sat on the mat\" and store that, and call if back up later --- this is the machine you want.It comes able to do nothing.All the software must be download.All the software is designed to grab money from you by selling you this account and then that account.Can't make a note, and get it back without going through many complicated steps.And putting in lots of secret numbers.And establishing accounts, with the money grabbers who want to send you a bill every month.All they want is all your money, all your data, and all your time.If those are things you want to get rid of and have less of, than this machine will take them off of you.I do not know that the machine can do any other thing than what it tried to do to me.If you are a circuit board engineer or a software programmer, there could be something in the machine you could use. But not for over $100.My Aspire One bought 20 years ago runs WORD totally clean. I can write a file, store it, and get it back.",

    "reviewText": "I love my little Chromebook!! I've had one before and it got old and they quit doing updates on it, so I had to get a newer version. So be careful to check the useful life of your Chromebook when you decide to get one. When they stop automatically downloading software updates it's only good for another year and a half or so before you slowly start losing function. This model will receive updates through 2030 so I'm happy with that. Only problem I have with the concept of Chromebooks is that it's not compatible with my printer. I guess there must be a special \" chrome printer\" out there somewhere? I'm making due by using my phone to print off anything saved in my Google drive account. The most wonderful thing about Chromebooks is that I don't ever need to worry about viruses or antiviral software!",

    "reviewText": "***Update: I amended this review from three stars to one star, because a couple of weeks after I posted this initial review, my computer simply stopped working. It will turn on, but I get a plain black screen. With all the other issues I was having, I simply decided this was not worth the hassle and returned it. I will also note that I didn't mention it in my initial review, but this whole process also included another purchase of the same item that was for some reason flagged as undeliverable during shipping, so I never received that one. It's just become a massive headache that's already worth more than $80 in my time and energy, so I opted to simply return the computer.The return process was easy at least, but I will not be buying refurbished electronics on Amazon again.I'm leaving my original review below for posterity.***I bought this computer advertised in \"like new\" condition for around $75. I wasn't expecting miracles, but there are a couple things I have an issue with enough to give a 3 star review. They're not a big enough deal to request a refund (again, $75 computer here...I feel like going through the process of requesting a return/replacement is more of hassle), but not great. If this had been advertised for its actual condition, I still might have bought it, but I'd be giving it a much better rating.Biggest one is that in my \"like new\" computer, the track pad is wonky. It sometimes catches clicked down in a way I can feel if I click too far to the bottom left, and I have yet to be able to successfully highlight anything because the drag is weird. Neither of these are a huge deal for the way I plan to use this computer (especially because the touch screen does work fine so worst case I just highlight by touch), but it's less than I expected based on the listing.The other is that my computer arrived dirty, which I wasn't surprised by as other reviewers have mentioned it, but it was kind of disappointing. I don't think it was anything particularly gross, but there was a goopy smear on one of the device's silver-colored hinges that was rather off-putting, along with a spray of dried droplets on the screen. Probably just grease or oil and the residue of cleaner, but let's just say I cleaned the whole thing thoroughly before I used it.Overall, though, I just needed a really cheap computer to get me through a couple weeks, and this fits the bill. It runs fine other than the trackpad issue, comes with a decent charger, set up easily, all that good stuff. Just, you know, be aware that you're definitely getting what you're paying for!",

    "reviewText": "Just as stated in the header and as many have rated it is bargain for a reason. I purchase one as a small personal device as i have my phone and pc the second one was for my child as a learning device and a first introductory lap top/tablet as he is 5 years old and is in home-school program. The price is a steal if you are looking on the cheap side. But make sure you dont get upset when it may come with defects.Pros: Value, 2-in-1, compact.Cons: No cap button and defects vary.As i stated I bought two as shown in the pics; the first one I bought seemed to be brand new never touch; no problems, so i decided to get a second to appease my child as he was immediately drawn to it and i figured it would be a great tool for his schooling. some of the best features from Google is the supervision so i can monitor what my child is doing limiting how much time he is using it for and so on. Sorry if this is a run on. the only fustrating thing is the No Cap button as u are forced to shift + what ever letter ur trying to capitalize in replace is the quick button to google search which i find annoying retraining the muscle memory of my fingers.Another thing is that some time it will not power on and you have to google why and find out why there is a refresh button. They also provided two different charge cord DO NOT SWAP! Other wise it will crash; any way hope this help in deciding if it is worth the buy. iMO it is as I wanted something not expensive does the basics and is both a lap/ tablet.**** UPDATE ****in order to stop with the google search button you can change the keyboard layout or its control functions in Setting > Devices > Keyboard> Custom KeyBoard Keys... It took me almost 1month to figure it out. Hope this help some one.",

    "reviewText": "When it arrived, I thought by the paperwork provided and reviews that the laptop would be in great condition working. I wasn’t using it so much in the first month or so after receiving it, but once I wanted to start using it for work and school, I noticed the battery would not stay charged for longer than 5–10 minutes unless constantly plugged into the charger. Some applications were also lagging when I tried operating. I waited some time but then when the problem became really persistent especially since I needed to use a laptop on daily basis for my job and school, I started a request for the seller to help me with the issue. I get a response that it is over the 90 day refund/replacement time frame (it was 5 days over when I put the request in) and that basically they can’t help me. I started contacting Amazon and multiple representatives started an A-Z claim, even though it was past the 90 days, I was told that I would be helped with the issue since the seller was not responsive. After a month of calling customer service, and being told that they understand my frustration and my issue would be fixed (I would get a return/refund), I’m now being told that Amazon can’t help me either. I am still currently trying to get my issue resolved with Amazon, but I would save your time and money and not buy from this seller. Almost $400 down the drain for a laptop that doesn’t function how a refurbished laptop should (I didn’t even get to talking about the cosmetic damages sticker cover up). I would strongly recommend saving up for a brand new laptop somewhere else if you are able to, because this will cause you issues (not far) down the line.",

The laptop needed to be heavily updated, including updating to Windows 11, some required Lenovo updates, along with updating some of the AMD drivers.However, regardless of that, the screen looks really good and the speed seems quite decent as well. The touch screen works pretty well.On the exterior, there are a few scratches around the bottom of it, but I think that is standard for used laptop like this. It is otherwise clean.Battery life is pretty great and tight. Can remain steady for a 4-6 hours doing light tasks.In summary, the quality is incredible for the price. The build is strong and as long as you know how to use any other Windows computer, this one should be easy to use as well. Despite it being refurbished and besides a few minor issues mentioned earlier, its as good as new.",

    "reviewText": "The Thinkpad I received was in functionally perfect condition. The body of the laptop had no scratches whatosever, the display had no scratches or defects like dead pixels, and the keyboard felt brand new with keycaps that were definitely unused and free of plastic wear or fingerprinting.The Ryzen 5 Pro 5675U benches nearly as well as an i7-8700K overclocked to 4.9 GHz in my testing, making this one heck of workhorse for the price. Gaming was also surprisingly good despite no dedicated graphics after I installed 32gb of RAM for an additional $40, then changed the VRAM in BIOS to 4GB.Genshin Impact ran at 1080p, 0.8 render scale, and medium settings with a comfortable 30 FPS. I was even able to play Armored Core 6 at 720p low to medium settings with a steady 30 FPS. Classic games and indies will be zero problem, as I've been playing Guild Wars on its highest settings at 1080p 120-200 FPS in most areas.The value here is incredible. You get a fairly powerful CPU for the form factor and price, and even some casual gaming capability, all for $320. I would suggest a RAM upgrade to 32GB, however, because the integrated Radeon graphics will dedicate some amount of the system RAM for itself. That brings the total to $360 in my case, which is still an incredible value for the system you're getting here.",

Actualice a Windows 11 sin ningún problema y el equipo se encuentra funcionando muy bien.Estoy muy complacido con la compra y me ha resultado muy útil hasta el momento. esta reseña la estoy realizando tras un mes de uso, instalación de programas, actualizaciones y diversas pruebas.",

On opening I was surprised at the condition of the laptop, I bought it on the premise it would be excellent condition, I'm not disappointed, it is like new! Great quality, would recommend to anyone. It came with windows 10 pro installed, I'm now in process of upgrading to windows 11 with no issues at all. Very happy",

El uso que le voy a dar es para la escuela a nivel bachillerato y para hacer reportes con el Reporteador de Microsip.Jueves 02-May-202420:32 - En la descripción menciona que no tiene pantalla Touch, y efectivamente en la hoja que incluye lo que contiene no esta marcada la opcion de TOUCH y confirmo que la pantalla de mi laptop no es touch.Viernes 03-May-202411:30 - Agregue dos imágenes donde se muestra el ducto del ventilador semi tapado con pelusa, y por ende se calentaba mucho la LapTop, lo limpie (17-Mar-2024) con un cepillo de dientes y le agregue pasta térmica nueva, y ya no se calienta la Laptop. Notese que perdi la garantia al abrirla, pero si mejoro mucho con la limpieza del ventilador.",

    "reviewText": "At $190, this laptop was a total steal. The 2k screen looks great, backlit keyboard is nice, and it charges 50% per hour give or take. I have not used it heavily, but expect the battery should last around 10 hours under moderate use, more than enough for my needs. Setting it up was a cinch, by scanning a QR code with my phone. It boots in <5s, and runs fast for browsing/streaming. I bought a USB C hub with HDMI to run an external monitor, which works fine. Steaming Call of Duty Black Ops 6 via Steam also tested out ok. While Amazon says this is renewed, there's no sign of wear or use, it looks brand new.I was surprised I could actually install Steam on this, via browser (NOT the Google Play store's version). Rocket League runs locally, but \"run\" is a generous word when its <20fps at lowest settings. Terraria works fine, but I would not say this PC is capable to play local games. With those two games installed, I have about 40GB left of free space, it started with about 75GB free. This laptop is better served for browsing the internet, Google Docs, and streaming videos/games, but that's exactly what I was looking for. No complaints.",

Even though it was bigger than i normally use, i was going to keep it anyway but unfortunately relentless wifi issues made me return it. Constant disconnects from anything requiring a reliable connection. Amazon luna constantly kicked me out, geforce now and xcloud both had constant disconnects. I couldnt get through a 20 minute zoom meeting without a dozen reconnects. I have other devices, including chromebooks that dont have any issues with my internet. Being a chromebook means i cant swap for another wifi chip leaving me to return. Perhaps it was only my unit but truly unfortunate.",

    "reviewText": "I've preferred Chromebooks for Linux software development for the last few years (vs buying a Windows laptop and dual booting). I really love the screen on this -- can work on two docs side by side, nice clear text in native resolution, and the keyboard is nice. I returned a similar Acer 'gaming' Chromebook that should have been a bit faster, but the keyboard was inadequate and one key kept falling off (other than that, both of these refurbished machines were in excellent condition as promised).I hope the Linux virtual machine continues to be supported on Chromebooks. I usually just buy Asus, and still have a decent flip with a good 15 inch screen, but that machine is shutting down randomly -- I should probably wipe with a factory reset but that's a chore.",

    "reviewText": "I was so undecided as well as nervous picking out a new computer. I didn't know where to start. Went to some stores, fiddled with some on display and got a feel for size, keyboard performance, speeds, layout, and whatnot. Then came to how much and what each ram and gig storage was. Googled reviews on some I narrowed down to 3 and compared everything to prices. This computer was at my price point and provided the necessary amount of everything I needed for school and work. The battery life is amazing...but it's also still new, it immediately loads and connects, Internet browsing is seamless, it's light weight and easy to carry around. The screen size isn't too big or too small, watching movies and videos with no issues. I love this computer and am so glad I purchased it. Well worth the money!The only two issues I would change but not anything I'd send back and cry about are the volume is a bit low and the charging connection. I'm not a fan of the tiny little connector as my clumsy a$$ would probably bend it and ruin it. But otherwise now I'm just super vigilant to it and have adapted to being more cautious around it.",

    "reviewText": "The right hinge on our Lenovo started pulling up on the casing, which in a matter of weeks led to the screen breaking completely. All of this was bad, but since it happened after we'd only had it for six months, we should still be good, right? The Lenovo manufacture warranty covers hardware failure and defects during the first year, so surely this would count?After more than an hour on the phone with Lenovo tech support, unfortunately, the answer was essentially, \"nah, we're good, take care of it yourself.\" Why, you might ask, would a manufacturer warranty not cover an issue with the hinge of the laptop destroying the laptop, after only extremely light use? The guy on the phone told me, \"Hardware doesn't count the outside of the laptop. We mean hardware like the motherboard. Only the INSIDE of the laptop is covered.\"So, buyer beware. Personally I'll never buy another Lenovo product again. And I'll certainly never waste any time thinking their manufactures warranty is worth a damn.",

It was very easy for her to carry around in her bag to her classes. Performance-wise, it struggled a bit with more demanding programs like Source Film Maker and Photoshop but was still able to pull through in the end. The laptop showed signs of giving up after pushing it so hard with the programs her classes required, but she was able to trade it in for a new one in 2022. All in all, both of us were satisfied!",

    "reviewText": "The laptop and everything arrived very quickly everything looks brand new. Turned the laptop on and got it started going through updates and everything. The charger didn't work but they're really cheap and I got two for $23 shipped just incase another goes out. The laptop is working great no issues with anything also found out it has a touch screen which I either overlooked that part in the description or it's just standard on these either way that works good too. Highly recommend this laptop for anyone just trying to do simple work with it. Light weight so it's easy to take with you on the go. The storage is enough for your needs I added a external 4 TB Hard drive for all my pictures and videos. All in all it works great order an extra charger with it just incase they go bad after awhile anyways.",

    "reviewText": "I've never purchased a refurbished computer before, so I wasn't entirely sure what sort of condition it would come in. I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised and satisfied. As an edition to my review, I must report that the only thing I'm not entirely happy about is that the battery life is short. I can write without a power connection for perhaps three hours. Besides that, the keyboard is clean and feels nice. It's a great layout, and all in all it's almost like having a new laptop, but at a great price. The seller promised to fix anything I wasn't happy about, and you can't get better than that. It seems to be fast and fully functional. I have the basic apps I was hoping for, so I don't have to go searching for them. The computer has a mic and a camera. I'm very pleased with the purchase.",

When received, the DELL manufacture date stamped on the laptop is 2017. Shipping was slow but packaging was good. Just laptop and power supply in box in bubble wrap. Aside from manufacture date, laptop specs were as advertised, HOWEVER the show stopper are; The internal battery is completely dead and will not hold a charge. The DELL diagnostics show that a test run in 2022 warned of a insufficient powered battery. My tests show the batter completely dead and the BIOS doesn't even recognize it. Also, the USB-C port with which I intended to connect to my DELL docking station was also dead. The docking station works perfectly with my 2-year old Dell Latitude. When plugged-in via the USB-C port, the laptop speakers squeal and the system locks up. I've sent an email through Amazon marketplace, an email directly to the company, and an email through their website customer assistance page. No answer.",

    "reviewText": "I've had it only a few days, but so far I'm very pleased. It came in A+ condition, WAY ahead of time, just like new, the diagnostics (F12 at bootup) are good, and it is a lively, very capable unit with an excellent display (at the very top of my gotta-be's was a matte screen, I use it in a very bright environment, and it meets that requirement perfectly). My only disappointment is that it doesn't have separate volume/mute buttons (it has Fn +/- volume, not nearly as handy, I guess I'll get used to it). One surprise: I assumed that there wouldn't be any damage insurance available, so beforehand I found a deal from Progressive, $200+ for 3 years, $50 deductible. OK I thought, not great but I'll buy it after getting the laptop. When I checked out, they offered 4-yr, no deductible insurance for about $150. That's a great deal for a 3 yr old laptop, surprised they don't trumpet it in the description.An update after 3 days: I found a few problems with the software that they should have caught before shipping. I got in touch with them and they immediately sent me a UPS return label for a replacement, but that would take over a week before I get one back with a mirror image of this one, which it set up exactly to my specs. Not an appealing idea. Fortunately it still has a warranty so got in touch with Dell. After getting cut off twice, the 3rd agent did a good job fixing it. So a caveat: if you get this, get someone who knows IT to check it out (I'm a little smarter than the average IT bear, so at least I knew where to look for problems). Unfortunately then I'm downgrading my rating to 4 stars.",

    "reviewText": "After reading the description i was unclear on what the laptop specs were actually going to be, so I rolled the dice. It turned out pretty well. Mine has the 7600 variant cpu, not the 6600 variant cpu. There is no touchscreen, but I don't normally use that anyway so it's not a real loss. I saw both 2560x1440 and 1920x1080 listed as max resolutions, well this one is 1080p. The SSD is an M2 NVME, pretty nice really. These are not new laptops but they are fast enough for my needs, I am very pleased with it.I cannot speak to how great the included Windows 10 Pro install is, because I blew it away immediately and installed Debian GNU/Linux instead. This product line is certified by Dell to run Ubuntu but that also means that any Debian-based distribution should run as well with minimal headaches. YMMV, but I was up and running in about 3 hours from the time I received it, most of that time was waiting around for various installers to finish or for my files to sync over the network.This is an obvious refurb. Prepare yourself for that. The case is slightly shopworn in spots, none so much to actually bother me. My biggest complaint is that it still smells like the previous user's perfume, and it grates on me, so I will working to find a fix for that.It came packed well, or least well enough as is necessary in 2024. Unlike the days of mechanical drives, SSDs can take a beating so the packing in the box is sufficient.All in all I am very pleased, though. It's in good enough condition it may as well be new, and even if it only lasts for a couple of years it will still be a great value.",

I connected the laptop to a Dell WD 19 Docking Station connected to two screens via DisplayPort and it works smoothly when the laptop screen is open or closed.In the photos you can see that I maxed out the memory to 32GB RAM. On the other hand I haven't stressed out the device, because I have not an everyday software that forces me to do it. Because the lack of a powerful and independent video card, I don't think it will run any modern game, but it should handle, some office work like Matlab simulations or some streaming and video editing and other \"everyday\" software used by most people.I believe it's worth the cost.",

It has a bright display, backlit keyboard, and a good touchpad. Sound is adequate. It has a nice look and feel, and it's lightweight - 2.5 lb on my digital kitchen scale. In overall appearance it resembles our spin 713, except it doesn't have the 3:2 screen. However, it certainly isn't blazingly fast. It scored 77 on the CrXPRT 2 performance benchmark, compared to 168 on our spin 713. Overall I think this spin 513 was a very good purchase.",

    "reviewText": "I think this is the first review I have ever done lol So I bought this laptop after my Levono Yoga C90 finally went out. Going from a state of the art Laptop at the time (2018) and with an overall price tag of $1400.00, I could not see myself going back to anything else. (It had a dolby atmos soundbar built in lol) It had everything and more than I needed. And when I decided to buy something I could take on the go and do my day to day. I came about this laptop on Amazon. I needed something that would able to do what I mostly do on my laptop. Word processing and watching YouTube and the other streaming services I cant live without lol and check into other social media if I felt like it. I spent two days doing research, and looking at YouTube videos and reviews of this laptop. When I finally got it home, I was surprised how thin and light it was. I am a musician and I was surprised how clear and how loud the sound would get. Screen was very clear and bright. The one thing I had to get used to, is the operating system. I have used Windows for 30 plus years. I was surprised how easy it was to learn Chrome OS. There are MANY features I miss from Windows. But for what I need it to do its holding up . Overall for this price I am happy. NOTE: I have seen some reviewers say there is not a back lit keyboard. THERE IS ONE. I would NOT of bought this laptop if there was not one. Thats the first thing I look for. This laptop is like an electric hybrid, light simple to use and will get the job done. IF you are looking for a juiced up race car with all the bells and whistles, then this is not the right laptop for you. But if you wannt something affordable and does all the above, then this might be for you",

    "reviewText": "Keyboard is flimsy and falling apart already. SLOW after required updates. Backlight on keyboard and speakers no longer work unless plugged in. USB port just died. Barely had 4 months and ready to scrap. Save yourself the trouble, there's a reason it's the cheapest in the category....Pros: responsive touch screen, backlit keyboard, lightweight, portable, excellent battery life, inexpensive.Cons: not as quick as it could be (but for the price plenty fast), screen glare in light, top shell is aluminum but bottom shell is plastic. The model is from 2021, the one I got was manufactured May 2021.I primarily use this for travel and laying in bed, for those purposes it works great. Don't expect this to hold up to a more powerful laptop, but for browsing or for things like Netflix and YouTube, it's great.",

    "reviewText": "It seems like I replace my chromebook every 2 years. I think this makes number 4. I don't replace them because they are bad laptops. I replace them because I always seem to spill some kind of liquid in them which damages the circuits and makes the laptop less functional and reliable. This laptop has a touchscreen and is by far the best Chromebook that I have ever owned. Be advised that this Chromebook states that there is a backlit keyboard but it does not. I reached out to Amazon support to swap it out for the correct model with backlit keyboard and they just sent me the exact same model back without the backlit keyboard. Very frustrating, but other than that, I am very pleased with it. Although I'd prefer a backlit keyboard, my time is way too valuable to keep playing the send it back and receive the same laptop, game.",

The Laptop top covering had a bubble after I opened & noticed this after recieving, then began to completly peel off more with everyday. I was excited by the price and thought thst I would be okay if this lasted less then 1 year but this wasn't the case and like I said lasted no longer then a full 5 days. WHAT A JOKE! One thing that I did not understand was that this type of computer holds not a lot of data. It is not the best for streaming, playing games, apps or storing old photos. It's for the easy stuff, maybe to do homework and some research. Just keep that in mind before you consider purchasing or products like this. Because I used it gently and it feel apart, PLUS BROKE DOWN 5 days after recieving, I DO NOT RECCOMEND TO ANYONE to purchase. PLEASE $AVE YOUR Ca$h for a better product. ***And most importantly Do Your Research AND READ THE REVIEWS!!***NOT HAPPY!",

    "reviewText": "I purchased this HP Chromebook 14\" G5 hoping for a simple and lightweight laptop to handle basic tasks like browsing the web, checking emails, and streaming videos. While it performs well for those tasks, I was disappointed with its speed. The Intel Celeron N3350 processor is simply not powerful enough for multitasking or more demanding applications. Unfortunately, this limitation wasn’t clearly stated in the product description, which could mislead potential buyers looking for a faster device.That being said, there are some positives worth mentioning. The Chromebook’s design is sleek and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The 14-inch screen is bright and offers good resolution for watching videos, and the keyboard is comfortable for typing. Additionally, the device arrived in excellent condition, and for a renewed product, it looks brand new.If you’re looking for a budget-friendly laptop for very basic use, this could work for you. However, if speed and performance are important, I’d recommend exploring other options.",

Many scratches on both sides of the keyboard. Surface scratches on the lid. I can actually live with that. Looked like a big dirt stain in the exact middle of the screen. Nope it’s a ding and it’s deep enough to fit the tip of your fingernail. The fact that it actually works is the only thing stopping me from giving one star. I was under the impression this was from Amazon but it’s an individual seller. I’m okay with that but maybe some more transparency and honesty would have me in a better mood",

Of course, you have treat it gently and keep up with any maintenance (both physical and software-related) This MacBook Air was a gift for my father. It came like brand new, free of any cosmetic damage like scratches and scuffs. Nothing!After examining the physical appearance we made sure we’re getting the right specifications, too. To see basic information about the Mac, choose Apple menu > About This Mac. In this case, this info was just as described.The battery is in great condition too and it last for so many hours, I don’t know exactly how many because I never let the battery to run out of power. Also We tested all ports:* Two USB ports* 1 Thunderbolt port* 1 MagSafe power port* 1 SDXC card slotAll five ports are working perfectly., as well as the 3.5 mm headphone jack.The Stereo speaker and the microphones are working fine too. The Full-size backlit keyboard is fantastic The backlit is sooo bright, but we know to pessF5 to lower keyboard brightness and F6 to raise it. That’s so simple.The MacBook came with “Catalina version 10.15.6” and it was asking to update to “ Monterrey’ , which at first we were very hesitant to do because the laptop ran so smoothly just as it came and didn’t want to ruin it. We consulted by phone the local computer shop and they said It's best for your computer to be on the latest software update. It fixes bugs, gives some new features, but most importantly, they have tons of security fixes. So we did it and now the laptop is running just as fine as it came, just with better features.All in all we are very happy with this purchase!!! Thanks Amazon for offering these amazing renewed laptops and many, many thanks to the vendor!!!",

    "reviewText": "I ordered one and the entire two bottom rows of keys stuck, would click like there was sand under the keyboard, or wouldn’t pop back up so my sentence looked like this“Mmmmmmmmy nnnnew laptop Is unnnnnnnnusabbble”So I reached out to Amazon support who processed a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was also unusable because the charging port would not hold the charger in it. So unless I wanted to sit there and hold the charger for 2 hours to charge it I had to return that one too. So I reached out to support again and processed that return.I ordered a third one hoping the third time would be the charm but alas, it was not. This one has a battery life of about 18 minutes from full charge until it’s dead. I understand these are refurbished but I have some major concerns about quality control at this point as it doesn’t seem like random bad luck that I’d get 3 laptops with major problems.Also adding that these are listed in excellent condition however there are also significant cosmetic issues as well. Scratches, deep dents, bent corners. Not something I’d look at and say “yeah this is in excellent condition”. I hope the seller takes more care in refurbishing these in the future because it feels like they are just out here taking in a computer, restoring it to factory settings and listing it for sale. No way they could do even a cursory check of these and not notice 20 sticky keys or the inability to charge a computer.This process has taken me about 3 weeks from placing my first order and has been a headache all around. I wouldn’t recommend these unless you are fully aware that you’ll need to dedicate time and money to making the computer you receive able to be used.",

    "reviewText": "I recently bought a renewed 2017 Apple MacBook Air with a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD storage, and it’s been a pretty decent product. For everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, and using apps, it runs smoothly. The 128GB storage is a bit small if you have a lot of files, but the fast SSD helps with quick boot times and file access. The build quality is great, as you’d expect from Apple, with a sturdy aluminum body and a bright 13-inch screen. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the trackpad is responsive. The battery life is another great feature, lasting a long time on a single charge.As a renewed model, this MacBook Air is a great deal. It’s a cost-effective way to get a reliable Apple laptop without spending a fortune. It’s not the most powerful laptop out there, but for general use and for what I’m using it for on the day to day, it’s enough. Additionally, the slim and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around. If you don’t need a ton of storage, this 2017 MacBook Air is a solid choice that’s easily portable with good performance and decent battery life. My only wish is that the screen quality was a little better. Overall, it’s a good laptop.",

The only issue I had was that when I opened the MacBook for the first time there were literal crumbs inside all over the keyboard but other than that it’s fabulous and works fantastically.

    "reviewText": "It showed up in amazing condition and I was able to update it to Monterey MacOS highest OS available to the MacBook Air 11” (early 2015). Technically Monterey is not supported by Apple Support or are they making anymore updates for it. But it carries Safari 17 and most sites like Netflix only require Safari 12.5 for standard streaming but Safari 15 to be able to view live stream content. So there’s a little wiggle worm to make this laptop last a couple years longer before programs require more OS functionality. So for me wanting a small laptop, keeping it Apple while wanting to not buy new and buy referb to be more eco and economic friendly… I am super pleased. Minor ding on the side but other than that battery life, track pad and screen all are great.",

    "reviewText": "I had a newer MacBook Air that was stolen. If you’re even moderately familiar with apple, you know that meant I lost tons of passwords too.I needed a cheap way to access my iTunes & be able to work until i could get a more current air..I purchased the “acceptable” version. It operates wayyyy faster than the same model 2015 MacBook Air I used to have (owned before the new one that was stolen) and the battery life is exceptional compared to my old 2015 one (which essentially became a desktop bc it couldn’t hold a charge)I HIGHLY RECOMMEND one of these refurbed airs to get someone through a jam like myself, keep around as a backup laptop, or for school age kids.The newer models are much faster, have c drive ports & Touch ID, & can hold a charge for days. So this is a great bandaid but not a permanent solution.",

Although it does convert and turn into a touch screen tablet, 15.6\" is a little too big and becomes a lap tablet, so unless your an artist, the tablet mode is too much. I don't want to bend the screen or risk breaking it so I don't use it like a propped up triangle, but it's great as is!!!

My suggestion would be to avoid the headaches, and time wasted (Amazon suport, Lenovo support, troubleshooting, lost productivity) by finding a different brand. Don't be tempted by the price. This brand is not worth it. Don't say I didn't warn you...............UPDATE: a replacement is scheduled to arrive tomorrow, which is good on Amazon.

Make sure to go into the HP Audio Control app and enable the equalizer and balance out the base so it doesn't sound tinny.- Integrated ATI video performs well even in mid range 3D video games.- The laptop arrived in mint condition and well packaged. Looks brand new. Koodos to the seller.- Came with Windows 10 Pro and you can upgrade to Windows 11 for free.- Fast solid state drive.- Super light weight and portable.- Nice long power cord (about 6 feet long)Cons:- The software for controlling the video card from ATI is confusing for novices.- The display generally looks great, but it can't reproduces red colors well at all. You will mostly not notice this unless you need color matching. Adjusting the ATI settings to compensate is impossible since it is a screen quality issue.- The screen does not get bright enough to use outside in sunlight.Overall, this is a great laptop at a super price. Highly recommend as long as you don't need perfect color representation.",

Window opened with \"Lets get started, choose your language\". I picked this one because I wanted a minimum 16 MB ram and lots of HD. The selling point though was the processor, very powerful for a laptop in this category - you can get better but you will be into 4 figures. It performs as i would expect so far. I even loaded WOW and it plays without a hitch, pretty god for a laptop with integrated graphics. Now for the one little issue I had. It would NOT work with an external monitor. Would not recognize one and gave a message that it could not use and external monitor \"try a different video card or reload the divers\". A different video card was not possible. I reloaded the driver and no good. I tried the built in windows tool to find a better driver, and it was useless as they always are. It did show the driver loaded on the adapter was from 2006 !! Holy crap, 17 years old? I was about to re-pack and send it back to Amazon when I decided to try one of those free driver updaters. It found a new driver from 2023, loaded it and bingo - it worked. A 17 year old driver....I was about to give 4 stars just for that but the 3rd party driver updaters are out there and easy to use so if you need to, go that route. Yes it is small and light and some call that \"flimsy\" but small and light is what I wanted.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works great, like new except..",
    "reviewText": "I received this computer the day after I ordered it, and it looked as new. I set it up, updated Windows, and found that the SD card reader didn't recognize any cards I put in it. It also didn't recognize another monitor plugged into the HDMI port. I took a clue from another reviewer, downloaded the Driver Booster app, and ran it to find and update drivers. Once that was done, the SD card reader worked, and the second monitor did. So, I am giving this four stars. Those two things should have worked out of the box.After that, I found the computer fast and so far does what I want it to do, but it does have issues running the latest Photoshop, but for the price, I am happy with it. I like the keyboard, and the fact that it is lighted helps in lower light. The computer has a very fast start-up.One thing that is not ideal is the trackpad. It doesn't respond to my input well, and it sometimes has to have my input twice.All in all, I am happy so far with the laptop that I am using to type this now.Two weeks in and It's been great. It charges fast, takes maybe 30 minutes to fully charge, and the battery life is good. The touchpad is great. I have never liked touchpads, but the one on this computer works great.",

Its fast, quick the camera works great and the audio is very good as well. Im extremely pleased with this laptop. If I had a choice I probably would have gotten the one with the Ryzen 7 over the 5 as I plan on keeping it for more advanced Cyber Security career.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Choose which seller you buy this from wisely",
    "reviewText": "1st unit bought from seller Chrome Source which was horrible. The mac arrived rattling around inside a medium sized Fedex box. Opened it to find the mac was just wrapped in single sheet of bubble wrap then tossed in the box. No fragile label or anything on the outside. Luckily the cosmetic appearance was still good. However, I tried to power on and battery was completely dead. Plugged it in, turned it on and had to wait about 2 hours for battery to fully charge to test it. Checked the battery life and found the \"Battery Service Recommended\" warning. It had a total of 749 cycle counts on the battery and 4049 mAh life remaining. Nowhere near the guaranteed 80% battery life or better on this unit. The unit was very dirty, hair and crumbs falling out of keyboard and every port including power port had dirt and lint built up in it. This is by far the worst \"renewed\" product I have ever bought. I immediately contacted seller, took them 2 days plus going through Amazon customer service to get a response offering to replace. I opted to just return it as I already purchased a second unit from Platinum Deals which showed up very clean, in like new cosmetic condition, packaged well in an aftermarket computer box, full charge on the battery that had 6100 mAh of battery life remaining well over 80%. The second unit I kept. Point is, be careful what seller you go through. I would absolutely buy from Platinum Deals again but will never purchase anything from Chrome Source again. I will be leaving a positive review on the second unit purchased from Platinum Deals.Update: For whatever reason I can only leave a single review even though I purchased 2 of these from 2 different sellers. I am leaving the negative star rating due to my first experience because I feel that is more important for others to see but hopefully my entire review will be read. As far as the 2nd unit purchased from Platinum Deals, I give it 5 stars in all categories.",

Tons of error notifications and indicated an update was needed to a completely new IOS and is about 6 updates behind . It never turned on again. I would think the seller would refurb and update to work in current time before shipping.Save your money and the hassleStill haven’t heard back from seller and only option is a refund that takes 5-7 days after they receive it back (despite my data being on the machine and the delete via Apple is throwing an error code).9/8 update: seller has responded. Asked for photos of a cosmetically perfect laptop to “send to their quality team” when they were told numerous times that it was a software issue. Escalated to Amazon several times and reported seller. Really cautioning against buying from them. I’ve had a laptop I couldn’t use for almost 2 weeks while they’ve held my money.",

    "reviewText": "This 11inch HP is the perfect device for me as a creative coach and freelance designer. It's my second small convertible touchscreen laptop, cost far less money than my first and with every bell and whistle I currently need. It's incredibly versatile and a great option for anyone on the go for work or school.There are two cameras and the clarity of the main cam is phenomenal! I get compliments on how nicely I'm lit when using it. The camera for tablet view is just to the left of my left hand - so you don't have to juggle between them when it's folded back. One can be on the subject and one on you. I haven't played with it much, but it's a cool feature. The touchscreen is very user-friendly.It has Windows 11 and it's as fast on startup and during use as is claimed in the offer. Worth every penny for bootstrapped coaches and entrepreneurs struggling to get work done on an older laptop. I thought about it for about a week because I was considering a more expensive pc, but if I needed to buy for someone else or for myself - I'll be looking for the latest refurbished model just like this one!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Purchased 01/2024 Reviewed 04/2024. Preliminary review:1. Item received nicely packaged to prevent damage during shipment2. Overall impression of item when unwrapped: Good looking device - apparently a \"skin\" was applied to it to coverup any scratches, etc -- liked the look of the skin, slightly textured in appearance & helps with gripping the device. However, not sure of the ability of skin to stay on with prolong handling, one corner of laptop skin keeps pulling away from corner. Solution - I put the laptop in a protective case, which also protects laptop if it should drop/fall3. Setup & operating laptop - setup was easy & have experienced no issues with operating the laptop with the exception of adopting to a new/revised way of accessing information. The windows platform was different on my old HP & I found myself stumbling around trying to find out where to go for stuff like settings, download, documents, volume control - etc. but I've been able to retrain myself to the new setup4. I miss the volume control button that was on the side of the laptop on my old HP, that was so simple to use, but I have since found out I can us the Fkeys to control volume5. Great speed downloading & uploading, for websites & pages on websites6. Vibrant colors on \"desktop\" type pages & when watching videos, mostly I watch YouTube but have also connected to other internet video services, as I want to use this when traveling for entertainment videos7. Can't comment on gaming, as I don't do it, but from what I've been using it for would say this could be used for school or job related use8. Battery lasts a long time, like the raised keys on keypad area9. Disappointed in the amount of storage on the actual device, my old HP had 1000gb on hrd/drive & this has only 128gb, which seems to be a trend on devices (limited hard drive storage) but when deciding to get this I decided I would use a usb drive & transfer stuff I needed or wanted to keep, so having usb ports was important [I know you can get larger hrd/drive storage, but then the price goes way up]Finally, I was very impressed with this \"renewed\" item. I didn't know what to expect when I opened the box, but overall item appearance & performance has made me glad I took a chance on this.",

    "reviewText": "The laptop looked really good cosmetic wise but once my daughter started high school and started using it after only about 4 days, the device got stuck in tablet mode. I immediately contacted amazon support and they tried getting me to change it through setting but the \"tablet mode\" they had me search for in systems WAS NOT THERE. Even on the task bar there is suppose to be something that switches the mode on or off but absolutely nothing!!!! I am truly disappointed in this because I am an international buyer and now i need to figure out how i will get the device back to the US so i can return it. I really hope other people have better luck with this than me but I don't think i even want back a device like this. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE and no one that i spoke to from the support team could have helped.",

Works well as a standard laptop and in a tablet mode. Touchscreen is responsive and works well 99.9% of the time. Once in a while a browser tab won't close with the touch of my finger; my be related to the sensitivity of the screen itself and the fact that the 'x' isn't that large. Obviously not a huge problem as I find myself trying to use my work laptop as if it had a touchscreen when it doesn't.",

    "reviewText": "I absolutely loved my first Chromebook, which I bought in 2018. Since it had been awhile, I didn't realize Chromebook wasn't a brand and now everyone has a Chromebook. Because I was so happy with my first one, I checked and Lenovo was the manufacturer. So I figured they got it right the first time. And they were highly rated, you know by the people paid to highly rate companies by the companies. And I had been doing research for a couple months! Boy was I wrong. Even if you get the same cellphone, you expect certain improvements, all things being equal. Someone explain to me how the NEWER laptop is worse than the OLDER laptop! I'm so disgusted, is it weren't for the fact that my old Chromebook had a cracked keyboard and wasn't getting updates, I would have returned it immediately. But I'm lazy and didn't feel like going through the whole process again. But very angry since this is something I'm stuck with for a few years. It's slow beyond belief. It's glitchy beyond belief. YouTube is constantly freezing and the circles keep going so that when you click on the one video you want the whole screen will refresh and down the rabbit hole you go because now you've clicked on something else and now you gotta go back. And if I have two games open, the second game to be open will forever have the task menu bar showing, but the picture isn't adjusted for that so it cuts off the graphics.Oh! Oh! And let's not even talk about the volume. I'd shout but you wouldn't hear it through the Chromebook. Pathetically low volume, but the thing I really didn't understand was that when plugged up, yes plugged, not even Bluetooth, the volume was the same pathetic level as it was on the laptop. Last I checked, we used speakers to get louder, but not with this bad boy. This was not the case with the first Chromebook. I used my old Chromebook as an entertainment system, all the time! Even without speakers it kicked butt, but now the new one- this one, is quieter WITH speakers than the old Chromebook was without!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This seems to be a great little laptop for general web browsing, school work or even remote work. Good size screen, brightness is good. I had zero issues installing Google chrome, not sure why it was an issue for anyone else. When I first started it up it did take a little time to get going as it needed to install updates but once installed it seems to be fairly quick. Reading reviews its not great for gaming but that’s not an issue for me since I have no intention on using it for gaming. I’ll write a follow up in a few months but happy with this so far!",

    "reviewText": "It’s a computer for $100 give or take. You really can expect only so much out of it. It does the trick. Only issue to me its that it’s a pain in the butt do download google chrome on it, which, I wouldn’t care about using necessarily however apparently a lot of programs online only work with chrome. Not a dealbreaker though. It’s a little slow but she gets the job done. If you want a computer to blow you away with how great it is, spend some more money and get a better one. BUT if you need a nice little laptop to get the essentials done, this will do the trick. But if you’re going to get all nitpicky then invest some more cash in a different computer.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars HP 14 Laptop: Great for a notebook under $200, But Keep RAM Limitations in Mind",
    "reviewText": "The HP 14 is a great choice for those looking for a basic laptop under $200, but it’s not for gamers, designers, or anyone who does more than the basics on their computer. Most surprisingly, it’s even decent for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display.The basics: It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that’s a breeze. And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM.**Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:*** **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I experienced some slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once.* **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed!* **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam.* **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam’s card can be emptied daily with ease!* **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn’t have an hdmi or a card reader.**Here are some things to keep in mind:*** **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use.* **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings.* **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users.* **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM limits multitasking capabilities.I don’t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I’ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks!**Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once. However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**",

    "reviewText": "This is the second one I've bought. The first was to donate for our local kid STEM Lego League group. I liked it so much I got another one for me to use in meetings. I gave up on laptops some time ago, no meetings, using a real PC for sw development. But, ever increasing meetings, so this is the perfect solution.It isn't any speed demon, it uses an obsolete Intel Celerion N series processor, has no way to add more internal storage other than the 64G eMMC. But, with 16G of memory, it is actually surprisingly responsive. It's still supported by HP, it's brand new, just discontinued. I don't love the small screen, but it is a 14\" screen, so I'll live with it. Comes with Win 11 and surprisingly it's quite responsive running it. Do be aware that it ships with the idiotic S mode Win 11 that locks you to the MS store and such. But, other reviews notwithstanding, follow the unlock directions, no issue at all going to full W 11. It doesn't even have too much of the usual preloaded bloatware. The usual McAfee trash, a bunch of HP 'tools', and a lot of the usual MS garbage. It does come with Office, if you care. I only need Excel, so this is a slight benefit. For $250, this is a no-brainer if you just need something portable for email, spreadsheets, etc.",

Keyboard buttons stick and cause issues when typing. The battery life under little to no use lasts only 2-4hrs tops before needing to be recharged. This issue has happened to a friend as well as we bought these at the same time for work. There is no support past the return window so we are now out $260 each for half working laptops. I would steer clear of this model",

    "reviewText": "This thing was a pain in the neck to set up any software not purchased at the “Microsoft Store.” Even programs that were pre-loaded on the system as purchased could not be activated or accessed without knowledge of how to access the magic handshake that Microsoft support would not provide. I had to go to individual software providers such as McAfee and Adobe to figure out how to enable commonly used programs. Even setting up an existing HP printer was not for the meek..everything defaults through HP’s cloud and, again, no support from HP to enable local print spooling. The speed and user interface is no better than the 8 y.o. Windows 10 system I replaced (forced obsolescence, because Windows 10 won’t be supported past 2025 and many programs already could not be updated). Then there’s this flash-card approach to local storage…what a cheesy way to force users to buy storage space in the cloud. Now I know why iOS and Google based systems are more expensive and likely worth the premium.",

I’ve owned quite a few laptops and never had one bite the dust this quickly, not even close. “Brand new” batteries don’t degrade that fast. Period. Seller says “sorry to hear it”. YOUVE BEEN WARNED.Update: Laptop is now completely trash. Certain keys began to sporadically stop working and now it won’t take a charge at all. Transactions like this are the reason I’ll never buy another computer or piece of tech from Amazon. People can just screw you and there’s no recourse. Awful transaction start to finish.Update: Purchased a Dell from Best Buy for about a hundred dollars more than I spent on this one. Two months of use and it works perfectly, plus I have the peace of mind knowing that because I purchased the extended protection I can take it in should any problems arise. I should’ve done this from the beginning and I recommend that anyone who reads this do the same.",

    "reviewText": "The laptop was a great price for the horsepower. However, I was unable to get Ubuntu 22.04 to boot up on the laptop. I run Ubuntu Linux on all my computers and rarely have an issue installing on a new computer. This laptop was the exception. I attempted to install Ubuntu 22.04. The installation went smoothly, but the system would not boot up. It kept saying it could not find the file-system. I then attempted to install 24.04. Again, the installation went smoothly, but the system would not boot up. I then attempted to install 20.04. The installation went smoothly and this time the system did boot up. However, when I performed the release upgrade to go from 20.04 to 22.04, the upgrade went smoothly but the system would no longer boot up. I must have tried some 20 installations attempting different BIOS and kernel configurations before finally giving up and returning the laptop. I ended up buying a different HP laptop from Sam's Club with which I had no problems at all installing and booting Ubuntu 22.04.If you are going to stick with the stock Microsoft Windows installation, then this laptop is probably a great buy for you. If you intend to install a Linux installation instead, then you should avoid this laptop.",

    "reviewText": "This is a good little computer and it's an annoying little computer. It is good that it is light weight and easily slips into a knapsack with no noticeable weight increase. Watch the battery life, it drains rather quickly and is slow to charge. The unit also cannot be used at night, unless, and this is a big unless, you are a master of the keyboard. The reason I say this is because the keys do not light up. That is a big deal to me, because my last little laptop key's lit up and I could continue to work into the night.Perhaps this is a new feature, or I haven't figured out how to fix it, but the icons line up on the left side of the screen and do not save. Meaning, every time I want to go to Google, I have to manually type it in. I set Google as my default search screen and it always defaults to Bing, another thing I do not like.So, in the end, I believe this was a get what I pay for system. It's good in that it's light weight, the processing speed is awesome, but that could be my internet provider. I do not like how the websites that I go to on a daily basis do not save on a top rack that I can just click on. The keys do not light up and that is a big downer for me.2.5 stars for this unit, but I gave it three, because it really is a solid little computer, the set up is just not to my personal liking.",

    "reviewText": "Our 6th grader needed a no frills \"laptop\" for her assignments at her new private school. They had school-issued ones in public school, but we need to buy one for private school (no prob).I read a few reviews for restored laptops on WMart dot com. They were mostly bad reviews about prpducts that arrived filthy, broken, scratched up, & in terrible shape. So, I decided to come to trusty ol AMZN to see what they had to offer on the \"renewed/restored\" list. I found this one & took a chance, since I could just get a refund if it arrived in terrible shape. I am so impressed!!!!!! We pulled this right out the box, plugged it up (charger included) and set it up. Clean, no scratches, in excellent (like new) condition. It is not touchscreen, which I knew, but this will do perfectly for my daughter.Full transparency, between 2020-2023 when she was doing digital learning at home due to the original COVID shutdown, she broke about 5 tablets/Chromebooks. She is rough on devices, so I was not thrilled about spending a lot on this school supply.So happy we found this listing. At this price point (under sixty bucks) I'm back today to buy 2 more (one for my 6 year old who wants \"his own computer\" & a backup for our rough 6th grader). Christmas is in the bag!",

    "reviewText": "This Chromebook unit was refurbished. Paid $99. There is a vinyl sheet glued to the top so I suspect the top was scratched or badly worn. The edge of the sheet is peeling.The unit did not come with a charging cord so I called Amazon and they shipped a power cord a few days later. This unit has two USB ports and one HDMI port. Also has a port for a micro disc. The key pad has a mouse touch pad but I use one USB port for a wireless mouse, The unit is working properly.Chromebooks offer a good option for school work and new users to computers. The 11.5 screen is adequate and the operating system if fine for web browsing . There are several system applications and more can be downloaded from Google Play, much like an Android phone.The Docs app can be used to write letters, The Sheets app is for spreadsheets. Also has a camera for virtual meetings.Not a good unit for gamers. Similar to using your smartphone. Connect to internet using Bluetooth or tether to your phone.",

When the Chromebook arrived I checked that it had several years of updates available, and it did. However the Chromebook is too low quality to be any use for anything: the screen is low-res, washed out and awful. The keyboard is so bad it's impossible to type on: although none of the keys was broken, half of my keypresses (on any key) didn't register, and it felt like there was sand under the keys. The hardware is hopelessly under-powered for basic web browsing tasks like reading email: having even 2 or 3 tabs open slowed the machine to a crawl. And the laptop isn't particularly small or light. I pity any schoolchild who has to do homework on this, it's a terrible experience to use. I returned mine for a refund.",

    "reviewTitle": "Poor Attention to Detail on Refurb",
    "reviewText": "Firstly, the chromebook I received has less ports than the images on the Amazon page. On the Amazon page each side of the chromebook has 1 x USB port and 1 x USB-C port, for a total of 4 ports. On the chrome book I received only one side has ports, for a total of 2 ports.Secondly, the keyboard was filthy. It didn't go through a basic cleaning process, so my first experience with the device was scrapping gunk off the keys. This wasn't even regular grey/brown finger keyboard gunk either, it was orangey-red. The only time I've seen gunk like this was when I drank too much wine in university and puked everywhere and it was somewhat dry the next morning. Pehaps that's even what happened to this chromebook.On a possibly related note to the filthy keyboard, the '8' key does not reliably work. It needs to be pressed very hard for the pressing of the key to register. It is possible other keys have this issue, I've only noticed the one so far.There is also a crack in the frame above the tracking pad. If everything else was okay, I wouldn't let this get to me, but a crack in the frame is more than the 'superficial' imperfections that were advertised.I would be returning this unit immediately, but I need a laptop in a couple days for work. It does seem like it would be a decent unit if it were new or atleast didn't have keyboard issues.What I received was clearly not what was advertised.",

It runs on all the up to date programs. It does sometimes turn off for no reason or be hard to turn on, so much so that I be thinking it's going to die and not come back on (but this I think is an HP issue not the seller). It came with a free year of Microsoft Suite which is a huge selling point. However, I have learned a lot over the last week ab buying products like this on Amazon. So if I have to buy another laptop from Amazon. I would buy the Amazon renewed premium since it has a 1yr warranty and comes with a check list of what was tested, battery life, etc.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars HP does not honor warranty",
    "reviewText": "I thought this was just the right PC for us. We don't need much, web browsing, some gaming, some MS Office work. Yesterday I saw that the laptop OS needed update so started it. Noticed it was taking some time so I just let it do its thing all day. Went to turn the laptop back on that evening, and got a flash from the monitor but nothing else. I knew it wasn't a power issue because the separate mouse (not included) was lit, indicating it was connected. Tried everything I could think of then went to HP website. HP tells me there's 15 days left on the warranty (\"whew!\") and gave me repair options (phone, chat, local warranty provider [Best Buy]). I chose to go to Best Buy. They worked on the laptop for about 25 minutes, and while I can't tell exactly what was done, I do know it was a series of keystrokes and a flash drive. Geek Squad hands the laptop back to me and tells me it's a hardware issue and not worth the cost of repair. I take the laptop back home and get in a chat with technical support. They have me do what appears to be the same steps Geek Squad did. Then they tell me I need an empty flash drive to reset/reinstall the BIOS. Now I'm not really that tech savvy, but I know enough to tell the technician that all the steps that they have had me do I already had done by Geek Squad, their authorized repair center. Tech tells me that without doing that last step with the empty flash drive they cannot determine that it is truly a hardware issue (really??!) and that they won't be able to give me a repair/replacement if I don't take that last step.Sorry, HP, but you cannot convince me that the cost of a replacement laptop is worth more than the bad taste in my mouth, and my withering review (not only on Amazon, but to anyone who asks) of your inability to honor your very limited warranty. I can't imagine why you wouldn't send a replacement of a low-end laptop just to keep positive goodwill towards your customers. And it's why I strongly suggest anyone reading this review to search for a different unit.",

I sure hope this thing isn’t a dud like all the other one star reviews say that this thing crashes and burns after 9 m to 1 year. If so this computer shouldn’t even be marketed. Downloaded python app fairly easily so I have high hopes.",

    "reviewText": "This is my second time buying this computer. I dropped the first one on its head and broke it in half. It was my fault and not an issue with the computer itself. If you drop it from a table height when it is open, it WILL Break. I went looking for a new one and found this one at a great price. The pink caught my eye and is pretty in person. Great size and weight for taking to work. A few things to note: in certain light, the keys are hard to see. I solved this by adding a silicone key cover and it worked beautifully. Secondly, computer this does not come with a SD card slot. I didn't know that when I bought it (again my fault) it was an easy solve and definitely cheaper than my broken that came with a SD card slot.",

I spent $599.00 on a refurbished laptop without knowing it.Don't waste your time with ASURION either, they will only repair it as well.AMAZON is useless as well, stating they can't do anything because it is out of the return window. They know it was sold as new and still are of no assistance. Buy from a store, not this lying company or Amazon.",

It's plenty fast for me which is email, surfing web and streaming, that's really about all I use or need it for. I will agree with others the battery is lousy, don't know if it came semi-depleted or they're just lousy batteries, but I've had this for a year and I'm lucky if it lasts an hour. Just ordered replacement. But will say after a year of use no issues with the laptop itself, which came in for around $175 as I recall. I bought the purchase protection plan for 2 years just in case, maybe another $40 but touch wood have no needed it. I'd say buy with confidence.",

Because I have waited a LONG time just to get this (long story short, UPS couldn't find my place, sent it back to headquarters or whatever, had to get a refund and reorder it AGAIN) that now, I could see how this laptop holds up. And so far, it holds up pretty well. The laptop was in a box and another, smaller box. Very well packaged. The cord was wrapped up nicely to the side. When I opened the laptop, it was fully charged, which was nice. Now, you could get a mouse for it if you are not fond of the touch screen because they have two USB ports. I am using 1 port for a fan to help cool it and know the 2nd one I could use a mouse...or charge my phone. Whatever.I also like the fact that this has 8gb...I have seen a lot higher prices for just 4gb so, to get this, with 8, very nice features, good ratings, all for a price of around $250 or so (taxes and such), this laptop was worth the (unfortunately long) wait. I will continue to work on this more and see if there are any cons. I do know I get a 90 day warranty, which is also a nice bonus.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fast, sleek, love the feel, an amazing buy",
    "reviewText": "I bought this laptop for use in my new home-based business. My old computer was slow. This one is amazingly fast, and I love that it has Windows 10 Pro. I have seen this same computer listed at Walmart for $1500, and this computer has everything I need. Setup and update was the fastest and easiest I have ever experienced on any computer.I have only had this for a few days, so I'm sure I will discover even more features as time goes by, but for now, here are my favorite things about this computer.<ul><li>It works flawlessly with a second monitor hooked up to it</li><li>It has a 10-key option built into the keyboard. If you hold down the Fn button on the left side of the keyboard, you can use the 10-key function with your right hand. I thought about attaching a second keyboard to this so I would have 10-key, but now I don't have to. </li><li>The power cord plugs into the back instead of into the side, which just works out better for me. </li><li>This computer is lightning fast. I can have 10 or more open tabs on my web browser, and it doesn't slow down a bit! </li><li>I don't know what it is about it, but the touchpad just feels nicer and seems easier to use. The surface of the touch pad and the area around it is textured. Maybe this is what makes it easier. Also, the buttons are where you can see them, rather than hidden within the touch pad. </li><li>Mine does have a backlit keyboard, but do be aware that this is a luck-of-the-draw feature. Not all of these will have that. </li><li>The battery life seems to be really long. I have not used it away from my desk much, but during the few times that I have left it unplugged for a few hours, I noticed very little drain on the battery compared to my old laptop.</li><li>The picture is very high-quality. I have a second monitor hooked up to it, which is also brand new, and other than the monitor being larger, I do not discern any difference in the picture quality.</li></ul>I will say it would have been nice if it had a touch-screen, but with all this laptop's good features and qualities, I adapted very quickly to not having a touchscreen.I am sure there are a lot of other things to love about this laptop, which I will discover over time. I will keep updating this review as I find more awesome features. I was a little nervous about getting a refurbished computer, but I am so glad I did. I never could have gotten this caliber of a computer within my budget, and it is what I needed. This is the best investment I have made into my new business so far.I use this computer for office and business-related tasks. I put it through a pretty good load with a lot of multitasking during use, in ways my old laptop could not tolerate. It seems to have the resources to handle everything I throw at it. I was thinking I would just buy a lower-cost laptop for now, then get a more expensive one once I get my business off the ground, but this one is a keeper!I do not know how this would perform for gaming, as I am not a gamer and have never tried any gaming. I just know it has everything I wanted in a laptop for business needs. If you need a computer for work or just for general everyday use, I highly recommend this one.",

I purchased a computer to do a part-time work from home job and I was able to make the money back. I used to buy the computer with less than two weeks, I’ve had no issues with the computer. The computer starts fast and I’ve had no problems with any updates to the computer. The screen is clear and the resolution is awesome. The computer is the perfect size and I am able to get a lot of work done for my part-time job and for anything that I do personally.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Built like a tank and almost as heavy",
    "reviewText": "What I like:It is built like a tank and will probably resist careless handling better than cheaper model computers.Sufficient memory to run the newer applications like Windows, 11, and Microsoft office as well as casual use photo editing, such as for making reports and magazine articles to submit.Really loving the back lighted keyboard, and the fact that the keys require a slightly harder tap then the cheap knock offs do. It's more like a typewriter and less like a cell phone if that gives you an idea.It is already anti-glare screen. You interferes with your sleeping ability if you work at night so you don't have to buy a separate blue light filter.Display is nice and crisp.What I do not like:The back lighted keyboard times out fairly quickly, and goes dark again. There's probably a set for that. I haven't figured out.The processor is slow,(by standards available in March 2024) so if you care about streaming, high definition, video or high resolution games, like second life, you might have to do a little wizard to scale down your settings and expectations.Incidentally, the tech papers I saw said you cannot overclock this model, so you're out of luck there.this thing is incredibly heavy compared to newer computers of similar size and even 17 inch ones! That makes it unpleasant to take to the café to work on with other writers... if you have a physical handicap, I do not recommend that you buy a computer this heavy.if you have a physical handicap or weak hand strength, I do not recommend that you buy a computer this heavy.(I regret the impulse buy, but it was an excellent deal and much needed.)The battery also seems to get tired quicker than my old Acer computer, but it is a much higher horsepower as far as the amount of memory it runs so perhaps that's the trade-off.(I am not saying the battery is bad)The cord is bulky but again it was cutting edge six years ago so I can't really complain too much that it is taking a lot of room and relatively heavy compared to any other device I have.(hoping this makes it resistant to small animals chewing it.)😝Like a ferret or a bunny or a cat... or even a budgie! Yeah seriously.(pets will be pets.)----------------(anti-monopoly, software rant... skip ahead if you like)Frankly, I hate the layout of Windows 10 and 11, but I am also chronically angry about Microsoft and Google and Apple dominating the digital world so there you go...* nothing* short of open source code, and lowering the monthly rental fee for their software like Word and Photoshop to something like five dollars a month for home users, will appease me - and other nerdy people who have taken the red Matrix pill if you know what I mean, -and allowing us to download an *actual copy * of the program, so we own what we are paying for , instead of forcing us to rent this stuff, and use the cloud - if you have Financial hard times, you are up a creek, )I am also vigorously opposed to saving my stuff in the cloud. But that is a problem with Google and certain other applications, and they do know exactly what they're doing if you read the business reports .It is nobody else's business what I work on and if I work on it, and where I choose to save it... they certainly don't have my permission to keep a copy (did you know they were sued for academic infringement roughly 20 years ago when they stole stuff to post on Google scholar ???)which they automatically do and you cannot prevent unless you do not use Google at all(!!!).----------------------But that is more of a gunboat marketing monopoly tactic that has nothing to do with the quality of the hardware I am holding. They are hostage to the system as much as I am. (manufacturers, build what they are told to build so they can get paid.)That said this was a over $2000 computer, six years ago when the processor was new release. I am satisfied it will serve me for at least the next three years.I will also note that it does not fit as easily into certain laptop, protective sleeves, and cases that are designed for 14 to 15 inch machines. Because it's kind of fat.! LolLike a tank😜but that is part of why I bought a brand-name and not a cheap knockoff from overseas that will probably break when I sneeze.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased a Dell Latitude 7490 from OLIVE Computers on the Amazon Renewed store, and the experience was extremely disappointing. The laptop arrived with a range of defects: the left mouse button did not work, the back cover of the laptop was loose, and, to top it off, they did not include a USB-C charger, which is essential for this product.I decided to return it immediately due to these issues, but to my surprise, OLIVE Computers charged me a ridiculous 15% restocking fee! This is completely unjustified as the return was due to the defective condition of the laptop, not a change of mind. I have since filed an Amazon A-Z claim, as this is covered by the Amazon Renewed Guarantee.For anyone considering buying from OLIVE Computers, be cautious! Their poor quality control and unfair business practices make them a seller to avoid. Save yourself the headache and choose a more reliable vendor.Final Advice: Don’t fall victim to predatory companies like this. Read reviews and take action!",

It took (still working on it) weeks to address so I had to get a backup. I didn't want to spend alot so I took a gamble on a refurb. It honestly looked brand new inside and out. I wouldn't have known it was a refurb. Came with Win10, I upgraded to 11 with no issues. I needed a laptop with some horsepower but didnt need the bells and whistles for a backup, til I get my main squeeze back. Well this PC answered the bell. Good performance, good enuf video, and everything works. No bells and whistles but its a solid performer, which is precisely what I needed. Very pleasantly surprised and happy. Fingers crossed.",

    "reviewText": "After unpacking this laptop, I looked and scrutinized the whole unit. I was very impressed, because this refurbished model looked brand new! No scratches, No dents, extremely clean!The setup of windows 10 Pro was a breeze, even the 10 G network over Thunderbolt was / is extremely fast. The i7 CPU, 16 Gb Ram, and Thunderbolt work together extremely well. It only took a few minutes to get \"everything\" set up. After imaging the drive to my NAS for safety reasons, I upgraded to Windows 11 Pro. Now I'm even more impressed! Absolutely error free upgrade to Windows 11 Pro. I'm using a Sonnettech Solo 10 G SFP+ Thunderbolt connection and it is crazy FAST. Reinstalling my software went through error free and really quick. I can definitely recommend this seller and would definitely buy from them again. I definitely feel that I purchased a very good refurbished laptop. Naturally, the 14\" screen is too small for me, but the HDMI port connects to a 27\" Samsung curved monitor which is perfect for me. Having a USB 3.1 hub with 3 ports helps when connection ports are limited. I did notice that 3 keys on the keyboard needed a little TLC because they wouldn't respond 100% correct, but after Q-tip cleaning they worked as designed 😉.I'm very surprised and happy with this purchase!One month update:I have put this laptop through the paces of rigorous office work and high speed network compatibility using a 10 Gb SFP+ Thunderbolt connection. This is awesome!It works flawlessly on my 10 Gb network and can do a complete laptop NVMe drive image in under 7 minutes. Even after the update to Windows 11 Pro the system is running great.If you need a reliable and fast laptop, then check out this seller, good quality and fast delivery, but hurry, they are selling out fast!",

    "reviewText": "I like this computer overall MINUS the camera glitch. I purchased this elitebook because I was looking for a budget friendly personal laptop. I have used a similar elitebook at my job, and it performed just fine. So, I figured why not. One con is that it is a bit heavy compared to the other elitebook I am accustomed to (don’t remember which specific one, sorry). This is minor.HOWEVER… I do a lot of work from my computer, including work that requires my presence on zoom and other video call softwares. Therefore I MUST have a laptop with a properly functioning camera. I contacted Amazon support and their troubleshooting method did not work. I contacted HP, downloaded several updates both on the computer system itself as well as the updates offered through the HP Assistant. Restarted several times. Camera still does not work.I am SO DISAPPOINTED ☹️.",

I unboxed it tonight two days before Xmas to set it up, huge disappointment I'll have to find another charger.Can't speak on how it functions as of now. Will update if I can get to that point.Giving 2 stars for now, as I believe the packaging was great.UPDATE: Bought a new charger. Have bee. Using this a month exactly. Function works great. We have had no issues. Holds a charge. Everything worms properly.So for the price I paid, this is still a great buy.Only complaint is the uncompatible charger. And at thar, chargers are cheap. There was really no loss for me.",

    "reviewText": "This was a purchase for my daughter, and she wanted to buy her own Chromebook with her own money. We found this one that was within the price range she was looking for. And even though it was refurbished I figured it would be okay since I was planning on buying the protection plan through asurion. When she received the laptop it worked for about 2 days without any issues. Then it started randomly rebooting on her in the middle of using it and would not turn back on. She plugged it in to charge thinking the battery was dead on multiple times, and it would only restart on like the 50th try. Then it would stop working, reboot and repeat again. I called asurion to make a claim. They told me due to the multiple issues they could not replace or fix the Chromebook and referred me back to Amazon for a replacement. Amazon told me they could not replace the item, they could only refund the money. So my frustration is that I purchased a protection plan that can't be honored, and also a device that can't be fixed. I'd be furious if I hadn't bought the protection plan and Amazon wouldn't have refunded the money.",

They are telling me that if I want them to fix it that I will need to pay for it and it will cost at least $400. I did not even spend $400 for the thing to begin with so I refuse to spend at least that amount to get it fixed. I have contacted the seller multiple times and have not heard back. The address they gave is a bogus address in Texas. Then I looked online and there is no phone number that I can find. I finally told them that if I do not hear back within a certain time frame that I am going to my bank to file a fraud complaint. Then file a complaint with consumer protection. I feel scammed out of my money.",

    "reviewText": "I’ve had this computer for about 3 weeks now and the exterior and condition of the laptop is great but I’ve noticed it does not keep a charge for more than 3hrs. I will have it at a full 100% and quickly starts to die if I don’t have it plugged in constantly. A few of the keys are worn out so you have to push them with more force than others. May seem like a minor issue but leads to a lot of autocorrection needed which is not ideal for those who write lengthy assignments. The sound quality also is diminished once it’s turned up over 70%, it starts to sound as if part of the speaker is blown. The last issue is the speed of the computer is not nearly as fast as my previous Mac which is actually older than this model. I definitely want to return this product but can’t afford to wait over a week for a replacement.",

I think during start up when I first opened it I may have either skipped it or jsut didn’t update but UPDATE IT MANUALLY if it isn’t updating it runs like a 500$ pc NOW so maybe hit up the other customers that are having a problem and make sure they update it ALL I had like 20 updates or more before they return it or suggest it to customers thank you for this pc it’s cheap runs great I almost returned myself but 5 ⭐️ after I figured out what I didn’t do.

    "reviewText": "It's cheap and can maybe help a poor college student who doesn't have much money, but don't expect to do much else with this clunky, languid hunk of plastic - I have just got this thing as of a few hours ago and have all but on thing open (Chrome - which you MUST disable S-mode to use) and the words are lagging as I'm typing this review - which is unfortunate because this device also has some unresponsive keys so I'm having to return frequently and make sure that I haven't (actually the device, but I'll be generous and take the fault) misspelt anything. Don't even think about opening more than one tab; the device will start spinning and start asking you how to deal with unresponsive pages should you attempt to open even so much as *one* additional tab while you've got only one open. I have just attempted to test this while typing my review, and not only did it need to reload the page on a tab I already had open prior to this, attempting to return to this page after the frustration generated by trying to revisit a page I already had opened resulted in this page freezing and needing to reload before I could continue my review. This is because the thing uses eMMC storage, which I am now finding out is notoriously slow. Get this thing because you are poor and only need it for one thing, and pray that it can even do that one thing reasonably.EDITED AGAIN: It's almost comical how bad this thing is; the first few attempts I made at connecting it to the my network ended in failure, only for the 4th time to be successful. The device froze and became totally unresponsive and I was forced to turn it off and turn it back on (it was laboring under the burden of 3 tabs being open), at which point I had to turn it off and on AGAIN because it wasn't able to reboot after being restarted. It installed some updates (lol), and then proceeded to lose internet connectivity again, this time taking at least 6 attempts, manually, to get it to connect. Moreover, it does not display any icons on the taskbar, you have to hover the mouse icon over them in order to get their names to display in order to figure out what you're clicking on.I recently suggested that this thing should be used only for school purposes and nothing else, but after seeing what a craptastic job it did of facilitating MyMathLab, I'm halfway reconsidering even giving it commendations for scholastic or educational purposes; it took it 8 tries to finally display anything in MyMathLab, and that was WITH pop-ups enabled, on a browser recommended for use by MML.The mouse pad is also frequently unresponsive. Really, just don't get this awful contraption.",

Although I have a cooling pad without the cooling pad it doesn't heat up as most laptop does. Is definitely portable with it's decent size able to fit in most laptop bags between 15-17 inches, and the keyboard lights up when pressed and turns off after some time of no typing, however you do have the option to keep the keyboard light on.

It runs fast most of the time and I have had very little problems with it. One thing to note is it isn’t great for gaming. That is to be expected. It runs simple games but nothing more advanced.

    "reviewText": "My more expensive laptop that was not even a year old had to be sent in for repairs and I needed to get something quick to use for work while the repairs were being made and this laptop ticked all the boxes for an incredible price. I've actually gotten my other laptop back but still have been using this one more. Overall I have to say that this laptop is pretty great. Beautiful screen, fast. For work I often have many windows open at a time and this thing has no problem handling that. My main use is editing and graphic design and it runs my work programs perfectly even with multiple programs open. Only issue I have is that the fingerprint scanner does not work great. I have reset it but that does not help so I mostly just use the pin instead, but I would love to know if there is a way to fix it. One other thing to mention is the power supply has an unusually short cord. I ended up buying a replacement for it that was only about $20 on Amazon. Despite those two minor things I still think it is well worth it. This laptop is an excellent value for the money!",

I like that it’s not bulky and easily fits into a small backpack so I can take it anywhere. It runs fast and doesn’t glitch when I’m playing games.Has plenty of storage and ports. Overall, it’s a nice laptop that is very inexpensive. Only thing I wished it had was a HDMI port. I’d recommend it for anyone looking to purchase a decent laptop for a great price.",

The replacement laptop has been perfect. No issues whatsoever. I wouldn’t say it’s a gaming laptop but so far works perfectly for what I need!The screen is beautiful and the touchpad is wonderful. The battery doesn’t seem to last too long. I’d say about 3 hours but I just try and keep it plugged up when I can.I think I would purchase again.",

Likely from a previous IT team or seller's inventory system. Not the end of the world, not enough to lose a star but a bit of an annoyance.For about $30 less than the \"premium\" version, this came about a week faster and was in good shape. Maybe I got lucky but I'm satisfied and would definitely buy again.",

It just seems like charging is such a basic function I don’t know how the hell it was the thing that was missed by these “experts”.Edit: Best Buy are the real hero’s here. Was able to get the problem diagnosed. Amazon wouldn’t even send me a replacement charger, even tho it was established the initial one was faulty. So much for a warranty.Over all good price- but you might spend a little more time and money covering for amazons “experts”",

Si buscan una laptop portable, para la escuela o trabajo que no requiera programas con muca carga para la GPU, es muy buena opción por el precio, los materiales se sienten totalmente premium y es muy estética.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I needed a good computer, but it turned out great! I thought it would barely run email and word processing and it does this well with Google Documents and Microsoft Word. However it can even do light games. On BlueStacks it runs Sims, Avakin, Tagamagotchi Forever, Fallout, and Shop Titans. Then on Steam it runs Stardew, Final Fantasy, and even Guild Wars. Memory is low, and so I plan to buy expansion cards. In addition the power light doesn't come on so you have to check the screen to see if it is charging. It only works when plugged in at the cord. Yet I needed an emergency computer to do applications for jobs, and this one has gotten me many interviews. It is my new favorite HP computer brand.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Well balanced budget system",
    "reviewText": "This is an excellent value for a budget notebook and I've bought and re-sold dozens of these from approximately September 2023 to February 2024. They are not perfect; in particular I wish that the least expensive model came with a more reasonable 500GB SSD rather than 250GB and that they keyboard didn't have the compact numeric keypad, but it does so many other things right that many budget notebooks get very, very wrong.There's a solid build quality to the Ideapad 1. The chassis doesn't bend or flex, which is atypical among low-cost options. The keyboard is quite comfortable in spite of being off-center due to the aforementioned numeric keypad, and the touchpad is easily up to the standards of mainstream and premium devices, unlike those found in familiar low-cost offerings from Acer or HP. The display is very bright and lives up to the common Full HD (1920x1080) spec. It's not a super high resolution display, but it does display color faithfully and accurately. It has three USB type A and one type C port.An AMD Ryzen 7320U won't exactly set the world on fire for performance, but it has four full-performance cores (8 threads), better-than-Intel graphics capability and substantially better power efficiency compared to the i3-1215U that is probably its most direct competitor. It's not ideal for content creation or gaming, but it's very well balanced for a ~$330 general purpose notebook. Another down side to this particular model is that it has soldered RAM rather than DIMMs. I suspect a lot of people would never even think to upgrade the RAM in a budget notebook and I do think 8GB is fair enough for the price.As far as gaming goes, it's just OK for older games. Minecraft, Roblox and World of Warcraft players probably won't complain. It's just not a good choice for your Cyberpunk or Cities Skylines 2 needs.",

The seller Techrefurb was excellent when an issue cropped up with the battery and went out of their way to make sure I got a replacement before my trip by extra testing it ... in this day and age its hard to find responsive sellers like this. As for the laptop, it works like a charm, is lightweight and Windows 11 ready even though I made sure I got Windows 10 Pro (Enterprise) when I was looking for laptops. Will update review after using it for a trip and more in few months.",

I don't know what part of my message was or could have been in violation since my comments were factual and supported by imaging.1) The device was represented as \"new\" as supported by an image.2) The device screen \"floats\" plus or minus 5 degrees, which is plainly defective.3) The serial number of the device was marked out which is a deceptive practice calling into question the legitimacy of the Windows license.This is not the service I expect from Amazon or Amazon vendors.Regarding this PC, buyers; I suggest caviet emptor. I'll return the PC and if there are any issues I'll dispute the charge with my credit card company. Amazon, I suggest you have customer support contact me if you chose to mute this review, as plainly there is something deeply flawed with Amazon and the vendor.Everyone have a good day.",

It is very responsive with all commands, has a great sound system, very lightweight and compact, very fast to use and to boot up, the keyboard is great, no scratches at all. The software, display, operating system, and hardware capacities are all incredible. The camera covering lid is also a game changer for me. It came in with the box and the charger, 0 details at all, except that some keys from the keyboard seem a bit dirty (see images attached) , which is the only downside I'm able to find with it, as well as the lack of a LAN port (which is something that I honestly overlooked while looking for a computer). I've only used it for 20 days so I'm not sure if the dirt on the keys is because of me.I tried a couple of games, and I would say that it isn't 100% optimized for gaming, which I don't really mind, since I bought it for university and work. Still, I would say overall I'm very satisfied with it!",

The drive cannot be found!I will never, EVER be buying HP again, and I strongly advise anyone who buys this to do so with extreme caution, because 4 months is a pathetically short time for a device (that is treated with the utmost delicacy) to fail.update: I sent it back to HP because it was still under warranty, as it was only 4 months old. I finally got a message back claiming it was \"user induced\" ----- they laptop has never left the desk it was put on since I got it, it has no scratches or anything. Perfect condition, except it doesn't boot. So not only is their product complete garbage, but their warranty system is bogus. I cannot stress enough how you should not trust HP and their products.",

It may cost more but it is definitely worth the money.The only issue I had was navigating Windows 11. My last Dell Inspiron I had for 14 years was a Windows 7. Actually I had it for 16 years but the last two years it has been sitting dormant because it wouldn't allow me to download an updated version of Windows. So I saved my money and recently purchased this new Dell Inspiron.",

    "reviewText": "Bought two of these and had to return both. The first one arrived and had a defective wireless card and would not connect to a network, which is required to set up Win11 (no ethernet port on this laptop). So I returned it and purchased another one same day as I shipped the return because I could not wait 3 weeks for an exchange. The second one arrived 3 days later and I did manage to get it set up and it worked fine for a couple of days. Then it would no longer power on. Completely dead. Tried leaving it connected to charger overnight. Still dead next morning. So I returned that one as well. And bought an Acer instead (which works great!).Be careful to review the return policy. Amazon does clearly states the return policy, but buyer beware. Both of my purchases were from Amazon Marketplace sellers, marked with Amazon Prime and \"Shipped from Amazon\". Amazon will not refund computer purchases until after they receive the item back and have time to inspect the product. Then it takes 7 days to go back to your credit card. It is not like most Prime purchases where you get the refund almost immediately after UPS scans the return package.On my first return, it took 3 weeks. That was from Seller \"Snow Bell\" and I eventually got a full refund. Then the second return took another 3 weeks, so I was carrying $1200 on my credit card while having to purchase a third replacement elsewhere (another $700 on my credit card). And now I am fighting with Seller named \"AmazingDeal Arrived\" on the second return as they are trying to charge me a $231 \"restocking fee\" despite the fact the laptop was damaged/defective and the restocking fee is inapplicable. Very frustrating and basically had to put $2k on my credit card and carry $1200 for 3-6 weeks waiting for refunds.",

After research ,going back/forth between brands and features this Dell had all my requirements. I have now had it for 2 months and I honestly love it . It’s my very first laptop and so far has been meeting my expectations. Downloaded my software with no complications has good memory although I save most my data on a hard drive I see great potential in holding up to my standards .its super lightweight so I highly recommend getting a laptop pouch/case for it . I personally travel with it so I had already purchased one with in the same order for under $10. Make sure nothing is under it preventing it from ventilating correctly because it will cause it to heat up! Overall great choice !",

    "reviewText": "The pros: set-up was super easy. I waited several days to start the process because I was dreading it. However, almost everything carried over from my old/broken laptop since I had a microsoft account. I have no complaints about the \"machine\" at all at this point and was very happy with the set-up process.The con: Microsoft S-mode! Good grief! I understand that it provides protections, but Microsoft Edge has typically caused problems on websites that I truly need to use, and that are safe. And, it continues to do so. For example -- my mortgage company. If there was a way for me to indicate that it's a safe sight, that would be helpful. As it stands now, however, I will be disabling S-mode so I can use my trusty Chrome browser again.",

I wasn't expecting much of anything out of this thing because I knew the price that I paid. I was sooooo wrong.I purchased it in \"Excellent Condition\" and it lives up to that. It looks brand new in every way. It also came significantly earlier than expected. I would recommend the seller any day.In terms of performance, I've tested out some of her favorite apps. It's more than capable of any streaming service, and it was able to run some of the most difficult Roblox games without issue. It does take a little longer to load some things, but that was expected. The touchscreen is very accurate and responsive. The screen also folds back completely, giving a tablet option (if you're looking for that). Honestly, I'm so excited to give this to her. Now that I know it's not a \"well this is the best we could do\" kind of thing, I'm confident that she'll be in love with it.If you're on the market for a budget Chromebook with good performance, just trust that this has all of the things you'll need. Massive thanks to the seller for an exceptional renewal, and an even better customer service experience. ❤️",

I can have multiple tabs open on Chrome and can enable 'free VPN' in order to stream British TV from ITV.comThe most annoying thing, and it's really annoying, is that what would be the CAPS LOCK button is instead a SEARCH button. To enable CAPS LOCK first click ALT then SEARCH, click the same or SHIFT to disable.So far I am happy that I bought this!",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars More Negatives than Positives",
    "reviewText": "Unfortunately, this was one of those purchases where the negatives out weighed the positives. The positives are that it's a working lap top for 80 bucks and it's a Chromebook, so it will probably keep working. The negatives were: (a) the enclosed power cord was so wrong for the computer that it wouldn't even plug and I had to order a new one; (b) it was advertised as a 2020 model and the sticker on the back plainly says 2019. This matters with a Chromebook because they have updates for a limited number of years and once the updates are over, so is the computer. So, this effectively knocked a year of usage off the laptop. Finally, the screen of the computer very definitely does NOT fold over as shown in the pictures - it's a standard 45 degree hinge. I've been very pleased with refurbished electronics on Amazon in the past and consider them a wonderful deal. The quality control from this company, however, is either incredibly poor or just plain fraudulent. Not worth the hassle of returning, but very definitely not satisfactory.",

    "reviewText": "I read all the reviews and had a few concerns, but after receiving the laptop they turned out to be no issue!First, the laptop was well packed and basically appeared brand new! As an IT professional, I did what I'd normally do with ANY used laptop. The first was I downloaded Windows 10 Pro, 64bit from Microsoft and created an installation media on a USB drive. Inserted the drive in the laptop and booted up from the USB by pressing F12. I chose to do a new install keeping nothing. Deleted all existing disk partitions. And proceeded with the install on the unallocated disk space. Then I proceeded to Windows update and let that update everything. Next I went to Dell's website for the Lattitude 7280, went to the diganostics and downloaded and ran their Support Assist. From there I picked to run all the tests. There were a few more updates, but everything got a pass on the hardware tests. Finally, I installed Avast & Malwarebytes Antivirus and CCleaner to protect things and keep it happily running!The main concerns I had were the backlit keyboard not working and poor battery performance... I'm happy to report the backlight on mine DOES work, and the battery seems to hold a charge for a good amount of time - like a new laptop should!At $135, this was an absolute steal!!! I've only had it for a day, but I couldn't be happier... this is EXACTLY what I was looking for!!!",

    "reviewText": "The battery life is amazing on this computer. I could use it nearly all day off of the charger. If you don't know anything about computers, it has a generally low RAM, meaning it cannot handle running big programs all at once (i.e. multiple browsing tabs+Microsoft Word+Microsoft PowerPoint+Spotify) without a noticeable lag. However, it for some reason you wanted to play Minecraft during your history class (but you shouldn't), you can limit your screen to a browser and the game, and it'll work fine. It has a lot of storage and a lot of accessories available online. It has multiple USB ports, a headphone jack, a card reader, a card tapper, and some other ports for other cables I have yet to encounter. It is the perfect work computer for after you move on from school and it will probably last that long. The CORE i5 mine came with will tell you it cannot not run Windows 11 (but you can find ways around that. Just don't tell anyone I told you that).",

    "reviewText": "This refurb laptop provides much better specs and performance for $150 than you would get for a $150 new laptop. Granted, the 6th gen i5 and Intel HD graphics are somewhat out-of-date but they are still great for everyday tasks and productivity. I also like how the SSD & RAM are upgradeable, and there is a second RAM slot so it only costs about $15 to buy a second stick of RAM and bring the total to 16GB. And while it is not “officially” upgradeable to Windows 11, I sideloaded it and I’ve got Windows 11 running great on this laptop. The 1080p full HD display is also a definite plus for a laptop of this price. My only complaints are that the laptop arrived with a subpar battery but I contacted the seller and they responded within the hour that a new one was on the way. The keyboard also isn’t backlit but that’s no big deal for me - but if it is to you than I would recommend you confirm with the seller first that it has a backlit keyboard. Overall this laptop is amazing considering its low $150 price tag.",

    "reviewText": "I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle. I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use. Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a \"bling\" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running.",

It came with a junky charging cord that needed to be replaced right away, but that was still under warranty. I purchased it in July ‘22 and now March ‘24 it died. It was inconvenient to wait for a new charging cord and 2 different batteries as I tried to trouble shoot it. Nothing has worked to power it on, and I am not paying asus to fix it as their warranty was less than a year.",

    "reviewText": "I got the 15 inch, i needed this mostly for a good laptop, long battery life, USB C Charging, and price. I looked at several \"higher\" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only \"missing\" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true \"lap\" top.Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE.",

    "reviewText": "It came free with a shell in a nice black color, it boots and runs well and has a decent battery life. I actually like that it's limited in what it can run, but that's just me, because it is mostly for writing and working. I have found ways to install older Mac writing and presentation software for my job. The highest priority was that it can open and run the latest version of QLab, which it does effortlessly. It also runs a few other theatrical programs I need to.Pros:Works well, good battery life, and boots easilyDistraction free work environment, and light weight to take anywhereHDMI port installed rather than needing connection for HDMIUSB Hubs all work as intended.Great inexpensive way to get a Mac for exclusive software like QLabCons:The OS is kneecapped by apple, by design, and there's not really a work around.Charging cable is super shortA little slow running anything, largely due to ageOverall, I highly enjoy my silly little laptop. It's kind of charming and goofy, and a good introduction to Apple for a PC user. After all, if I mess it up, I just wipe it and start again. Runs the basic software I need without much extra. Travels well, and provides me a 2 computer setup for when I need to run lights and sound for an event. I really am glad these renewed options exist for purchase. However, don't think it will run everything under the sun, it won't, but if you know that going in... It'll be just fine, and perfectly serviceable.",

Body: no signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away).\" and \"Fully Functional (exceeds 80% of original battery life, generic or OEM accessories and packaging provided).\"This laptop came filthy with hair, dust, and other junk within the keyboard and on the screen. The charger also came in the same condition with noticeable stains on it as if it was never cleaned. Furthermore, the keyboard was making weird clicking noises when pressing down some of the keys (ex. the arrow keys, alt, or space bar). The top right corner of the keyboard cover was also warped as if some sort of liquid had been spilled on the laptop, also somewhat consistent with the key board noises. Finally the screen had a large 6-7 inch scratch noticeable from well over 12 inches away, as well as additional scratches near it as if a cat had walked across the screen a time or two.Overall the macbook and its physical parts were okay and working good, but the cosmetic condition was no where near as described. The laptop was returned for a refund.",

I’ve always bought windows PCs so this is my first apple PC. I have to say I’m Impressed. It looks and feels sturdy.Functionality:It runs smoothly and USB data transfer speeds are much faster than my windows PC with an i7 quad core processor. Video playback even at 4k quality runs smoothly. The screen quality is good. I see no problems with it but it doesn’t amaze me like my Windows PC that was almost double the price of this MacBook Pro. The keyboard is simple and easy to use with built-in lights. The built-in speakers are are loud and clear which is huge plus for me. The power adapter is also well designed.Connectivity:The early 2015 MacBook Pro 13in doesn’t have a CD drive but it has a Hmdi port, 2 USB ports, 2 lightning ports, a head phone jack, and a memory card slot. Wifi and YouTube cast works but I don't have an apple tv to test desktop cast or a TV with airplay.Because it’s my first Mac PC I had to google basic features, commands, and how to use the MacBook.Overall I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another MacBook in the future",

It also has touch screen, touch pad or a mouse. The copilot from Microsoft is force on you so i guess it's time i learn AI. It has it's pro's & con's. Microsoft has the routine actions of messing with your emails accounts, telling you that suspicious activity was noted on your account.

After several weeks of back and forth with seller, I received a new (and correct) battery. Finally, the laptop worked as it should . . . for a minute. After about a month, it got to where it sometimes wouldn't power on. That went on for about a month and then it just wouldn't power on anymore. I took it to a reputable repair shop and they told me the motherboard was bad. Price to repair is about what I paid for the laptop to begin with. Clearly, this was a terrible purchase and a total waste of time, effort and money!",

    "reviewText": "Macbook pros are expensive and this was an excellent price given the amount of RAM and storage - the only problem was that the charger was damaged on arrival. There were cracks in the plastic that looked like age where and the block part had exploded. There was no obvious damage the box. The lap was fine and works well. It was confusing at first re: what to do because I had purchased the Asurion policy - and I wanted to keep the laptop and just credit for the charger. Asurion initially said to try to get the refund from Amazon and send it all back - but this would invalidate the coverage of the laptop or potentially require me to refund the laptop although there was no other one available at that price with those specs.Amazon pointed fingers at Asurion and Asurion pointed fingers at Amazon say it was due to their delivery, but the seller came through and offered either to give me another charger, or refund me $20 to buy a new one (I took the latter). In truth, the charger looked to be in poor condition on arrival and probably shouldn't have been approved by the seller, but I appreciate they stood by their product and gave me the refund. For me to buy another refurbished one would have cost me twice the price from Apple. So 5 stars for BuySPRY standing by their product.",

    "reviewText": "I mainly use my MacBook for productivity as well as for more intensive applications like virtualisation which it handles well. However, the battery life isn’t all that great my unit arrived with a battery cycle of around 450 which isn’t bad for a used laptop, but it drains relatively quickly even under a light load. What’s more is that it tends to heat up quite a bit. The keyboard gets uncomfortably hot and the backside can get burning hot, so much so I have to control the fans manually.I’d rate MacBook’s condition as average. On the surface the laptop was clean, however, the display’s anti-reflective coating was noticeably peeling (which looks like the picture I have attached) and the ports were also noticeably dirty. When I opened the inside the computer was incredibly dusty and dirty with grime buildup everywhere; the fans were even clogged by the dust buildup–it clearly had not been cleaned which I would have expected from a refurbished product. Additionally, charger supplied, although genuine, appears heavily used. It has multiple scratches and is bit grime, but works great.",

First, the battery life became unpredictable, draining within a couple of hours. Then, the touchbar started flickering, and now it won’t even turn on. I expected more longevity, even from a used device, but it seems like I bought a lemon. I tried reaching out to the seller, but they were unhelpful, and now I’m stuck with an expensive paperweight.

    "reviewText": "When it arrived, the MacBook was very well packed! This is my third Renewed Mac from Amazon. So I do know that there are going to be some minor defects or issues.That being said….honestly, I was impressed!It’s almost like new…with a small problem. When I went to remove the sticker on the laptop,(it had a sticker for inventory I’m assuming) the whole sticker and back portion of the screen aluminum side started to peel.Now, I did wonder why it felt a bit different than my other macs….and this was why.I really don’t think the seller did this on purpose, rather it was done by the original owner? To be fair, it was well done, almost didn’t notice it, until I started to remove the inventory sticker.Still not a deal breaker.Underneath was one scratch, most likely from normal use. It’s not a big deal, nor does it affect the how it functions.The MacBook is running in the latest OS, which I downloaded with no issue and also installed all my necessary programs with no problems!I do have a program that does bog it down sometimes, but I really feel that it’s how I’m using it not the MacBook.My only concern is the battery. Seems to die rather quickly for a Mac. But again, it’s mainly used at home for my music programs…and it’s very easy to switch out an old battery or memory on these machines (hint hint).The screen is perfect, no blemishes or scratches. And the keys show the tinniest wear, again, not a big deal.It did come with a new charger and cable! Brand new Apple charger! A big win! The last ones I bought came with aftermarket chargers and cables.Like I said, small minimal blemishes that really don’t affect performance and it looks amazing!I also did add a protective cover…Smokey gray! And it looks very elegant!Update!Still working just as well as the day I bought it!Worth every penny!😃😃😃",

I have the Ipad 13 inch (2024) so when I plugged it in to my ipad charger it turned on!When it turned on it was working great. All the keys worked and the touchpad work. Its was light weight and the sound was amazing! The screen play was clean and the camera worked as well. It does tend to get a little heat but something too bad.",

    "reviewText": "I love my new MacBook Pro. Coming from a lifelong Windows guy, that’s saying something. I’ve been a Windows tech/support person (retired) for over 25 years. Over that time, I’ve had very little interaction with the Mac OS. I’ve known for years that the Mac OS is a better, more secure and more robust OS, but that didn’t mean I wanted a Mac. Well, that recently changed. I took on a part time job doing support for a Linux NAS server, and an office full of Macs. To support the Mac users, I needed to fully understand the Mac OS. This brings us here.TO THE POINTDo not listen to the negative reviews for these “Renewed” MacBook Pros. My MacBook Pro arrived in perfect condition. Everything checked out like a brand new computer. It did have 50 charges on the battery, so someone did use the computer, and for some time. You could not tell by looking at the unit. I will also add that these computers are supposed to come with a fresh OS install. Mine did have residue from the previous owner, so I’m guessing they don’t always give you a clean install of the OS. That being said, if you get a Mac that doesn’t meet your expectation’s, just send it back. My plan was to give it a try. If after three attempts, I didn’t get a “good” one, I would give up. I didn’t need to do that. I was very happy with the first one I received. You can’t beat the price!To buyers coming from a Windows OS to the Mac OS. When I ordered my new Mac, a friend of mine (who has been a Mac tech longer than most people reading this right now have been alive) told me “don’t bring your Windows mind to the Mac”. This is so true. Don’t start by loading up your new Mac with Microsoft apps etc. Try Apple Pages, or LibreOffice (free download). Give the Mac way a chance. Forget about right click. Yeah, Mac has the Control click to show the context menu, but you will not see the Windows type options for creating a new document etc. Instead, open the app, create your document and then save it. It’s just a different way of doing things, but give it a chance before complaining about the way the Mac OS does it.That’s all. Enjoy your new Mac and have some fun…",

    "reviewText": "I've had this for a week now, and I'm going to try to do my best to give a thorough review.Pros:- It came in great, impeccable condition, really, with the right charger and everything.- Awesome battery life- Comfortable keyboard- Easy to navigate (I used to have a decent windows HP but it got destroyed due to a water accident, so I wanted something cheap that works, primarily for creative writing. I have limited experience with Chromebooks, but this has been super easy to learn)- Even though this Chrombook comes on it's last update (see Cons), there are still plenty of helpful add-ons to be downloaded from the Play Store. For example, the voice recorder I downloaded (and internal mic of the chromebook) produces better sound quality than my moderately expensive HP- I like the sleek, all black design- It doesn't run hot or loudCons:- Wifi detection can be pretty weak, so make sure you have access to a strong wifi connection- Headphone jack seems to be a little worn out, so sometimes depending on how I move the chord, the sound quality in my headphones changes (this is probably a problem that is exclusive to my chromebook)- It is a tad slower overall than middle to high end laptops, but not unbearable- Since Chrome is on it's last update, you can't download crucial extensions like Adblock.Overall, for 62 dollars or something after taxes, this is an amazing laptop. Frankly, I love it, and all the cons are not deal breakers at all. I guess it also comes down to the quality of the individual Chromebook that is shipped to you, as I suspect some are in better condition than others, but if Amazon's inspection process has improved, then I would think that the odds of getting a dud are less and less.Bottom line: If you want a laptop that's good and cheap, this is perfect for browsing, watching videos, writing. It's a tad slower than your higher end laptops, but oh well. It's fantastic, really.",

This is a scam i think these people are passing around the same damage chrome book nobody wants and keep returning. I pray amazon flagged them from selling this product. The chrome book should be a donation to goodwill instead of trying to sale it to anybody who would take it. The pawn shop would probably not take the reason they are scamming to sale it online to people when it should just go to goodwill for somebody 2yr old kid to play with it as a toy since it not even that functional at all i would not sale that book to dog its was horrible. No way anything on Amazon should be sold looking like that. I want my money back. Go donate blood if you looking for money instead of trying to bleed money out of people passing around the same damaged chrome book you know do not work and not functional at all.",

After about 2 weeks, one of the shift keys stopped working. We asked for an exchange, and got a 2nd unit. This one had issues right out of the box. The scroll pad, just does not respond correctly. Also, the Smartboard won't fully function with this unit.We were going to get a 3rd unit, but you can't, until the others are returned. But my wife is at least getting by with the original, until we get a fully working replacement. We decided to try a refurbished HP Chromebook, and are going to return the two Dells for a refund.",

It is the perfect size to work on without being too wide or bulky. It fits in what my mom calls my \"movie going purse\" (if you know , you know 😁). I ordered it late in the day, so I expected it to ship the next day but to my utter joy I received a message a couple hours later saying it shipped and would arrive by 10pm the next day. I was pretty excited that I would get it a full day before I expected. Once again though, my expectations were exceeded in the most wonderful way when I woke up to the notification that my package had been delivered. There was obvious care taken in the packaging to ensure that nothing could harm this refurbished beauty. I have to give props to the delivery peoples as well because the box it shipped in was even in pristine condition which tells me that from start to finish everyone involved in the handling of my purchase treated it like I imagine they would would their own. Anytime I need anything else I know who to look for!",

    "reviewText": "This one is going back! I needed an inexpensive Chromebook for a Ham Radio project and I like Dell so this seemed like a good deal. It is a low end Chromebook so I expected it to be slow and have low storage capacity. Both of those are true and I was willing to work around them. I normally steer clear of \"refurbished\" equipment unless I am very familiar with the seller but I took a chance on this one.What I didn't expect is that it would arrived damaged. Please look at the photos. At one point it had been dropped hard on the right rear corner so who knows what other internal damage still exists. (That's why I got the extended warranty.) It was shipped in bubble wrap in a plastic envelope so I don't know if the damage occurred during shipment or if it was sent that way. The box I sent it back it offers VASTLY more protection than the envelope the seller shipped it in.But it still worked so I was willing to live with it until I attempted to install some Android software from the Google Play Store. I can't! Seems this laptop is so out of date that it hasn't been eligible for updates since September 2021. As a result I cannot load anything from the play store and almost two years of security and system updates cannot be loaded. I didn't see anything in the description that warned about this so I am returning the laptop for a refund.The description reads \"This product is in \"Excellent condition\". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away.\" Look at the photos: you can see that damage from 12 FEET away. And, naturally, I have to pay return postage which will be about half what I paid for it.Beware when you see a computer \"deal\" on Amazon that features a \"renewed\" product unless security and functionality is unimportant to you. This seller, \"Tech Magnet\" is now on my permanent \"NEVER AGAIN\" list of sellers on Amazon.",

Someone recommend that I try buying a refurbished model for Amazon and here I am!This computer has been running like a charm and I find the Touch Bar fun to use. This computer has really allowed me to make my work mobile and its absolutely cleaned. No traces of past owner. The battery life works just fine. Anything longer than 3 hours is a bit excessive and sounds like ppl should take a break from work, haha~Anyway, the whole computer is solid and in great. condition. My only hang up is that the screw at the bottom was slightly out of the hole. that was weird. Aside from that I'm happy with my purchase.",

    "reviewText": "When I received it I was given a charging brick that would NOT even plug into any outlet I had so I ended up using my iPad brick. It finally turned out but I instantly noticed battery issues the second it was at 15% or so and it would jump up to 40% randomly then back to 15% or even less or just a tiny bit more in the 20% range, after trying to even log into my iCloud account, the laptop would just be in an endless loading loop so I never managed to log into my iCloud account. In addition to all of this the laptop would randomly just shut off (more battery issues) which is when I just gave up on it completely since no matter if it was plugged in at all times, it would randomly drop to 0% and die on the spot with minutes long wait times to boot back up again, some other issues were in the keyboard, the “n” key would have to be pressed deep to type the letter or it wouldn’t budge at all, same thing for the spacebar. This purchase was a complete waste of time, even at the highest price of $440~ I basically just bought a useless piece of junk laptop that can not function at all.",

Possible over-heating?I have now had the computer for five days and have just upgraded my review from 3 to 5 stars. My reason: the supplier sent a credit covering purchase of a replacement charger and there is no longer a potential overheating problem. Probably caused by migration of Dropbox files and folders, something typical to a new computer.",

The laptop worked fine until Sept 15th 2024 when it was not booting up. I tried a few things but the only sign was that Caps lock was flashing 6 times. When I decided to to see whats inside, I noticed that the Memory RAM is glued to the motherboard with silicon. I am still trying to figure out how to fix it but quality of the refurbished work is very bad, and definitely it seems that they just do minor repairs to re-sale those laptops without really solving the root cause of the problems. More updates to come..",

So I tried their 2nd choice of reinstalling a new version of Windows 10 for free. That worked. Now I have been able to install several programs, including MS Office, with no problems. All that took up 3 days of my time, but it's over now and I'm extremely happy with the computer. But not with the lack of customer service.",

Always go with Prime for delivery as you can count on a speedy/secure arrival. 3. Take your time, dig into the reviews for third party sellers if you're going that route - as the more you dig, the more commonalities you'll discover (good or bad).",

    "reviewText": "I was deceived as the description and specs of this laptop says anto-glare, backlit keyboard. I opened my laptop today and the function key for the backlit kb is blank (see photo). No backlit icon on it. Tried other function keys to see if the keyboard lit up but to no avail.I ended up checking the support.hp.com site and typed in the SN to see specs. To my horror BACKLIT KEYBOARD is not listed as a specification of this laptop. I purchased the backlit keyboard specifically to use the laptop to work at times in a dark room at home at night.To return this item is very costly.Not a happy customer at all.",

I replaced that laptop with a second one just like it, and experienced the same issue with the keyboard, plus the screen kept freezing. It’s not worth the money or the headache. I’d rather get a laptop brand new without the issues.",

    "reviewText": "I must say, I’m pleasantly surprised. This MacBook was in perfect condition and looks amazing. It was packaged appropriately. The charger is not quality but you can find a Walmart brand100 watt charger for under $30. I am not worried about the charger, and if I was, it would most definitely be cancelled out by how pristine this MacBook is. I had the item shipped to a UPS Access Point and it took a couple days longer but it was expected. What really surprised me is that it was shipped on a Tuesday and made it across the country in a day. In researching the cost of shipping something this size overnight, I was shocked at how much this company paid to make sure I got it by the quoted shipping date. The battery health is 88%, which again I was pleasantly surprised. I also love how much faster this M1 chip MacBook is versus my Early 2020 MacBook with Intel. It’s like night and day. Another highlight is that I basically live on my MacBook with work and I loved how fast it charged and how much usage I got out of 1 single charge. It beats having to always plan where I’m going to charge my laptop (airport, plane, car, etc.). As with any MacBook, the ease and speed at which I could jump from window to window was crazy fast. I don’t know how this company makes any money because of how pristine the MacBook looks along with them overnighting it to me to make the quoted shipping date. Regardless, thank you so much Platinum Deals via Amazon, I hope to do business with you again!",

The lid has some slight dents and a few small scratches. The screen has a small scratch on the edge. I contacted Amazon about the discrepancy and they offered me $100 credit. For what I ended up spending on it I can live with the slight imperfections. So far it has worked perfectly and the battery life is great. I don’t notice the scratch on the screen unless the screen is off. I covered the dents with some cute stickers. Only 4 stars because the seller didn’t do a good job accurately describing it.",

    "reviewText": "I must say, I’m pleasantly surprised. This MacBook was in perfect condition and looks amazing. It was packaged appropriately. The charger is not quality but you can find a Walmart brand100 watt charger for under $30. I am not worried about the charger, and if I was, it would most definitely be cancelled out by how pristine this MacBook is. I had the item shipped to a UPS Access Point and it took a couple days longer but it was expected. What really surprised me is that it was shipped on a Tuesday and made it across the country in a day. In researching the cost of shipping something this size overnight, I was shocked at how much this company paid to make sure I got it by the quoted shipping date. The battery health is 88%, which again I was pleasantly surprised. I also love how much faster this M1 chip MacBook is versus my Early 2020 MacBook with Intel. It’s like night and day. Another highlight is that I basically live on my MacBook with work and I loved how fast it charged and how much usage I got out of 1 single charge. It beats having to always plan where I’m going to charge my laptop (airport, plane, car, etc.). As with any MacBook, the ease and speed at which I could jump from window to window was crazy fast. I don’t know how this company makes any money because of how pristine the MacBook looks along with them overnighting it to me to make the quoted shipping date. Regardless, thank you so much Platinum Deals via Amazon, I hope to do business with you again!",

For what I ended up spending on it I can live with the slight imperfections. So far it has worked perfectly and the battery life is great. I don’t notice the scratch on the screen unless the screen is off. I covered the dents with some cute stickers. Only 4 stars because the seller didn’t do a good job accurately describing it.",

No worries about viruses and such because it is has a closed-end operating system. This current one has an end of life date of 8 yrs wherein automatic updates will continue for 8 yrs. After that, you can buy a new one or update manually. The screen is large and the font is adjustable. The sound quality is passable for those who just want to hear the audio and are not an audio expert. The keyboard is off center, so a lot of folks may need to adjust their finger/hand placement when typing. Otherwise, this is a great deal.",

It came with Windows 10 pro and I now have it running Windows 11. If anything changes worth noting, I'll come back and update this review.I can't say how customer service with \"RUKN-TECH\" rates, because I haven't had to contact them for any reason so far.

Anyway, that left me wondering about buying another brand new computer or going the renewed route. I decided on Olive Computers because the price was right. I am glad I did. The laptop arrived in a well packaged unit. I plugged it in and xferred the files from my old laptop using a SSD enclosure. In less than an hour I was up and running as though the old Dell never crashed. Very happy with this product. If I had one complaint it would be that the warranty registration that was enclosed does not work, I have tried multiple times to register for the warranty and it always responds with a server error.",

    "reviewText": "Empaquetado: LLego en buen estado, sin rayones, ni golpes, como nueva. Muy bien empaquetado, con unas burbujas lo suficientemente gruesas y infladas para evitar danos (teclado en ingles.)Experiencia inicial: por el momento no podria hablar a largo plazo y mi punto de vista es de alguien inexperto en portatiles, pero aqui mi experiencia en mis primeros dias.Descripcion: La laptop cumple con la descripcion, cpu, windows 10, Gb, cargador y velocidad, es rapida. Actualmente conseguir una laptop asi saldria arriba de 10mil MXN, por lo que considero que esta bien para el precio.Bateria: es buena, aun que depende mas de la funcion que ocupes y el tiempo que la necesites encendida, para lo basico esta bien, solo no la uses mientras carga en algo que pueda pesarle.Pantalla: yo la veo bien, sin rayones y en cuanto a calidad creo que es suficiente, siempre se puede configurar o mejorar pero realmente no suelo ser exigente con ello.Funcion: Por el momento esta bien, es rapida lo que es una gran ventaja, reamente no tarda casi nada al encender o al empezar a usarla despues de encender, no deja esperando nisiquiera segundos. Funcional en juegos no tan pesados. Comoda para trasportar fuera o dentro de tu casa, no hace ruido al calentarse, a menos que se caliente mucho pero sigue siendo leve, de igual forma comprare su enfriador pero para lo basico no se siente nada. Pronto comenzare mis estudios por lo que mas adelante editare mi opinion despues de un tiempo.Camara y microfono: no me e permitido usar la camara o microfono con gran detalle pero lo que vi fue que realmente no estaba mal, tampoco digo que sea muy bueno, tampoco suelo ser muy exigente en este aspecto, pero se distingue tu imagen y tu voz, eso para mi ya es aceptable, pero hay que recalcar que son funciones que no necesitare por lo que para mi esta bien si es visible, asi que si eres alguien que lo necesita siempre puedes investigar mas sobre esto (lo mismo digo respecto a la pantalla.)Detalles: Me gusta la luz del teclado, tambien es comodo y el talk pad me es funcional, al recibirlo, tarde en darme cuenta de una ligera falla en el teclado, no fue un gran problema pues recibi la ayuda necesaria del vendedor y ahora esta al 100%, no tuve un gran problema en la configuracion inicial.Servicio: Yo realice el pedido y me llego el mismo dia que lo compre con la ayuda prime de amazon, mi pedido decia que llegaria antes de 8pm y llego horas antes por lo que diria que el envio es bueno y cumplido en cuanto a la aproximacion de entrega, la persona encargada de entregarme el paquete cumplio con las medidas de seguridad como el nombre y codigo para entregarmelo y la caja del paquete llego en buen estado, sin golpes ni detalles con la cinta.Vendedor: Contacte con el vendedor por el detalle del teclado, fue amable y rapido, lo contacte en horas nocturnas, yo eperaba que me respondieran al dia siguiente pero fue en esas mismas horas, me entrego instrucciones y fue abierto en cuanto a su ayuda. Anteriormente ya lo habia contactado para preguntar por otro portatil (no tuve ningun problema.) Y me contesto igual de rapido y eficiente, para mi su servicio fue bueno/excelente, no podria hablar sobre su servicio en cuanto a devoluciones o cambios y eso ya es algo bueno, no dudo que si tuviera mas problemas o necesitara una devolucion me atenderia de igual forma.",

    "reviewText": "I've always been a Windows guy for PCs since Windows 3.0. Can you imagine that? And always Android since my first Motorola back in the day. This is my first dive into a Chromebook which I have been tempted to try for some time. I had been concerned about performance and the learning curve but a reason came up to give it a try.I have two notebooks, one Dell and one HP, the later for remote working, the other for personal use, finance, volunteer work etc, etc. Also have a kindle fire, a Samsung Tab 4, two Paperwhites, and a Pixel 6. Rest of the family is on iPhone and Macs, not me.Why would I need another device? Well I've started to pursue a side gig career as a freelance writer. So I wanted a device totally seperate from work and other life digital activities. I wanted a tool that was only for writing. I chose this device and am so happy. Beautiful design, fast, clear, great wide keyboard, which is important as I have big hands. The screen is great visually and good for touch, backlit keyboard for middle of the night work. So easy to setup, all my Google stuff came over easily.All in all very happy with this device and I really like the Chrome OS experience, nice to get away from Windows for awhile.",

    "reviewText": "If I could give this tank zero stars, I would. The biggest mistake or misstep, whatever you want to call it, was buying a Chromebook with only 4Gb of RAM. The Ryzen 3, whatever specs it has, is completely throttled by the lousy RAM. By the time you finish waiting for a page to load (if you have more than 3 tabs open), you'll be ready to go live in a nursing home. I don't know if 8 Gb of RAM would have mitigated this issue, but good God is this thing slow.Don't buy it. There are far better options out there at this price point. There are only two positive things that can be said about this wheezing tank. The screen is nice, and it better be because about the only thing you'll be doing on this monstrosity is watching movies on Netflix or checking your email. Second, it really is built like a tank. Heavy and solid, so when you finally get tired of waiting for a tab to load and fling it across the room, it won't break, whether you want it to or not.Those users giving this barely usable hunk of metal 5 stars can't be using it to actually get anything done. Too many 5 star reviews for this awful Chromebook to be believable.Update: 3 tabs open and it takes nearly 15 seconds just to close a tab and another 10 seconds to open a new one. Powerwash barely helps. Using this thing feels like a punishment from God.",

    "reviewText": "Really nothing to say that I dislike about the CBook. I've owned a number of them before. As I mentioned in the headline, the weight is heavier than I expected, but I don't carry it around all day. It does seem to \"hang up\" when I am on some sites, but that appears to be the site loading Adv. after Adv. while I am trying to read something. I am going to add an Ad-blocker to cut that delay back. It's a shame the advertisers are killing the golden goose(geese) by over-loading every page with more and more interruptions. The CBook is great for me.",

    "reviewText": "Very impressed with this Chromebook. This is a rocket ship compared to the old 11.5\" Asus Chromebook I had previously. Bright, crisp HD graphics, fast performance with its upgraded 13th Gen i5 Intel CPU and fast SSD makes this thing sing. Love the Gorilla Glass screen, makes for nice super smooth scrolling on the responsive touch-screen. The games I've played so far run buttery smooth. Also love the back-lit keyboard for when I'm using it in low-light conditions. For a smaller Chromebook like this, the upgraded DTS audio sounds great. And one thing that I wish all notebooks had is the fact that it has TWO Thunderbolt 4 compatible USB-C ports, ONE ON EACH SIDE, so whichever side is most convenient for you to use for charging, etc., its got you covered. A thoughtful touch. And the fact it came with its own nice padded sleeve is just icing on the cake. Yes, this Acer Chromebook is more expensive then most other 14\" Chromebooks but with all its features I found it to be easily worth every penny. Nice work Acer!",

    "reviewText": "**UPDATE** 22-7-2024: KEYBOARD letter \"O\" malfunction. From day 1 I noticed an extreme sensitivity of the letter. One slight touch added 5 additional O's (ooooo). I thought I could manage, but after nearly 25 days, it began to interfere with my work. I reached out to Amazon and was impressed with the level of support I was provided. Initially we reinstalled the keyboard driver, but unfortunately, I had to go with a replacement. Luckily, these days almost every thing I do is backed up to a cloud and so I won't have to reinstall much. Hope this helps others out there.**Original REVIEW**Recently purchased the Koolsmile 8-inch laptop, specifically the Mini Laptop with an HD Touch Screen running Windows 11 Pro, powered by the Intel N100 4 Cores processor, featuring 12GB LPDDR5 RAM and a 1TB M.2 SSD.This little warrior has proven to be a robust and reliable companion, ideal for on-the-go use.Compact and Portable:Despite its compact size, the Koolsmile 8-inch laptop packs a punch. Its lightweight and portable design makes it a perfect travel companion for both work and pleasure. It fits easily into a bag, allowing for convenient access wherever you go.Performance and Versatility:Equipped with an Intel N100 4 Cores processor, 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD, this mini laptop delivers impressive performance for its size. It's perfect for checking emails, creating documents in Word and Excel, drafting presentations in PowerPoint, and transporting documents. However, it's important to note that this device is not designed for gaming. If gaming is a priority, potential buyers should review the specs carefully.Touch Screen and Stylus Pen:One of the standout features of the Koolsmile 8-inch laptop is its responsive HD touch screen. The touch functionality is on point, especially when using the stylus pen that comes with the laptop. I find it incredibly useful for taking handwritten notes in OneNote and highlighting sections of documents when editing. This feature adds a layer of convenience and precision that enhances productivity.Battery Life and Charging:The battery life of the Koolsmile 8-inch laptop is impressive, lasting around 6 hours, which is well enough to get me through the day. The small charger is easily portable, making it convenient to carry along. However, it does take some time to reach a full charge, which is to be expected.Connectivity and Additional Features:The Koolsmile 8-inch laptop boasts modern connectivity options, including Gigabit Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and HDMI. These features ensure seamless integration with other devices and networks. However, while the built-in 2MP camera is functional, it may not meet the quality requirements for professional meetings and presentations. For better video quality, I recommend purchasing a separate small camera, such as one from Logitech's range.Accessories for Enhanced Use:For those with larger hands or a preference for full-sized keyboards, a small Bluetooth mouse and keyboard can enhance the overall experience. These accessories complement the mini laptop, making it easier to use for extended periods.Final Thoughts:Overall, the Koolsmile 8-inch laptop is an excellent choice for those seeking a portable and efficient device for travel. It's not meant to replace a primary device but serves as a perfect secondary tool for productivity on the go. With its impressive specs, versatile touch screen, stylus pen, and reliable battery life, it is highly recommended for professionals who need a reliable and compact laptop for everyday tasks.",

    "reviewText": "このUMPC(ウルトラモバイルパソコン)は、外出先や移動中の狭いスペースでも快適に操作できるサイズ感と、日常使いからビジネスまで役に立つ充分なスペックとを、ちょうど良く両立させていると感じました。私のように、今までパソコンはほとんどデスクトップを使ってきたモバイルデバイス初心者の方や、私の母のようにパソコンに触ったこともない、ご高齢の方などにも意外と良いのかもとも思いました。ポートはType-CにHDMIポート、USB 3.0(4ポートハブも付属)がそろっているので、他の周辺機器などとの接続もスムーズです。カメラ、マイク、デュアルスピーカーも内蔵。ビデオ通話も本機のみで始められます。オンライン会議や配信などでよりクリアな音声が必要であれば、3.5mmオーディオジャックもあるのでヘッドホンも使えます。インターネットは、Wi-Fi 6やBluetooth 5.2に対応しており無線でもよいですし、さらに背面にはLANケーブルポートもあるので、初心者にも分かりやすく安定な有線でのインターネットも可能です。CPUは省電力に強いIntel N100プロセッサ、バッテリーも連続3～5時間の使用に適しており、これでも充分かもしれませんが、さらに長時間連続使用する際には、モバイルバッテリーも併用すると良いと思います。充電スペックは30Wです。●ノートスタイルの実用性7mm四方のタッチパッドが搭載されていますが、さすがにこのサイズだと使いづらく感じました。クリックも可能ではありますが操作が難しく、スライドと誤認識されることも少なくありませんでした。そのため、小さなワイヤレスマウスなどを使うか、せっかくですので本機のみで活用するには、内蔵キーボードを使うのがおすすめだと思いました。キーボードの「PgUp」や「PgDn」で上下のスクロール操作、左右クリックはパッドの左下と右下のボタンです。また、もちろん画面に直接触れてのタッチパネルによるスクロールも、とても快適です。出先でも本機とスマホだけでWindows 11にタッチパネルと、ここまで快適にパソコン作業が出来るのは本当に凄いの一言です。●タブレットスタイルの活用私のような初心者には少し慣れが必要ですが、タッチペンによる入力が可能です。そして画面上に表示できるソフトウェアキーボードも活用できるため、個人的にはまずはこちらからが使いやすく感じています。状況に応じてタッチペンや画面キーボードを選べるので、慣れるにしたがってどんどん便利に手軽に操作していけそうです。また、一般的なタブレットの重さに慣れている方やご高齢の方にとっては、約0.78kgとはいえ、長時間持って使っていると手が疲れてくる重さかもしれません。●総合的な使い勝手持ち運びがしやすく、必要な機能がしっかり備わっており、使えば使うほど驚きの連続です。自宅や職場のPCモニターもついタッチスクロールしたくなるほど、特に私はこのタッチパネルの快適さを実感しています。キーボードは日本語キーボードですので、まったくパソコンの初心者の方や、ご高齢の方にとっても良い選択肢なのかもしれませんよ。以上、ご参考になりましたら幸いです。",

    "reviewText": "This was a complete FAILURE on Global Certified Authentic's part.When the product arrived at my door I was highly excited to open it and package it as a gift to my son who is an over the road driver.When I opened the product and inspected the unit I was disappointed to find the following:The casing had a deep scratch on the bottom of the unit. Multiple others all over the device.The charging port was completely useless. It looked as if there was a broken charger snapped off inside the port. The unit would not even turn on.Upon receiving the replacement unit and charging cable, the power supply did not have the proper wattage to charge the device.Again, disappointing 😞 .I contacted the company yet again concerning this issue. I was advised that they no longer had any chargers for the unit in stock and that a refund of only $15 would be provided. Would you please locate me an OEM Dell charger for this device for $15.Well, let me tell you something. The charger that was shipped with the only working unit on the first order which is what was needed for the second cost much more than the amount that was offered as a refund.The product description said excellent condition. These devices are to go through a rigorous refurbishment process to check them for faults to see what has to be replaced or repaired. Failure on Global Certified Authentic's part.Two orders and two failures. I will never recommend this company to anyone and will steer clear in the future.Amazon should delist them until they get there act together.",

It is actually a Dell 11.6\" Chromebook 11 3189 from 2018, and I have no idea why thy lied about it, I still would have bought it. I just wanted a cheap Chromebook to watch videos on, with and HDMI port, and that's what I got, but the deceit just really rubs me the wrong way. The condition of mine is pretty good but certainly not excellent. There is a small imperfection in the display, and the battery shows as 78% health. Both of which I would have expected to be fixed on a truly refurbished product. Additionally the laptop is no longer supported and will not receive updates from google any more, which is also pretty suspect considering its supposed to be 2021 model. Overall I got what I wanted, but I would recommend buying something different given the dishonesty of the description in terms of quality and the actual product.Update: The battery completely died within 3 weeks of purchase. I requested a replacement and they send me another one with 78% battery health out of the box, and it is a 2017!!! Even older than the last one.",

On opening it the charger did not work, that isn’t a big deal to me because of the fact I have another charger. If it were to be someone else it would be a different story. It was dead and took about 5 minutes to turn on when plugged in. When I looked closer at it I noticed a few scratches and marks but nothing I would be concerned or upset about, let’s be real it is a refurbished 2017 Mac Book. I was able to login quickly and everything has been working so far. I did have to do a software update because it wasn’t updated since 2021.All in all, I think it is worth the money. If you look at the price on a brand new Mac Book and don’t need anything fancy this is definitely the choice!",

    "reviewText": "I bought this computer, needing it for school work, and was a cheap option for someone who didn’t have a big budget. It worked okay for about 4 months, had some issues such as the battery dying very fast and overheating a lot. Learned to live with it and only keep a few tabs open. Eventually, it stopped working, and wouldn’t let me do anything on the computer since the wifi wouldn’t enable. Took it to a repair place, turns out the motherboard was dying the whole time and didn’t have long left. Extremely upset that I spent 333 dollars on this product and Amazon won’t refund me or do anything at all since its about 1 month and a half past the return date. Which I understand, but obviously they need to have exceptions or make the return dates on these longer since they are CLAIMING that these are in “excellent condition” When they are on the brink of dying. Very unhappy that there has not been any problem solving on Amazon’s side. And if you buy one, if ANYTHING seems off immediately return the product because it will probably stop working justttt after the return date so they can short you a couple hundred of dollars! And what’s even better is that in order for them to fix my computer it would cost over 900 dollars…. When I payed over 300 dollars to get it in the first place. I would’ve been better off buying a brand new macbook then this crap :) Atleast it would have lasted me A LOT longer. It also came with a horrible covering on it that wasn’t even centered on the computer so I had to peel that off. I would like a refund or atleast half of my money back since this thing didn’t even last me half of a year. Waste of 300 dollars that goes to this stupid company.",

    "reviewText": "This MacBook is honestly very good and I’m impressed. It’s in great condition but it did come dirty and I just cleaned it and everything is fine. I do have concerns about the battery life, maybe it’s because of the game I was playing or something but it went from 100% to 78% in less than 15 minutes. Another thing is the “i” key on the keyboard is a bit stuck and it types out twice like this “ii” but that really about it, everything else is great. This is my first MacBook and i was honestly scared of getting a cheap laptop because every time i did it couldn’t run the simple stuff that i wanted it to do. This MacBook can handle basic gaming like Roblox and Minecraft. It went through so smoothly. Another thing is when I’m searching the web and try to go to a website, it doesn’t pop up it’s like it’s loading but it’s not. It isn’t with all the websites i look up but it’s with just some of them. Overall a great laptop I recommend!Edit: I think I’m going to bring this rating to a 4. Firstly, I forgot to mention the sound quality, it’s amazing honestly I can have the volume up about three to four notches and it dang near sounds like I’m in a movie theater, but the thing is I’m bringing this down to a 4 because this laptop is pretty old and doesn’t support a lot of things like I can’t even watch Netflix from off this laptop and I don’t even know how to access so many things on here. The App Store is stupid I’m trying to look up how to navigate everything because maybe that’s my problem but I don’t even know what year this thing is let alone know how to find out the year so it’s hard because if I just look up “MacBook Pro” YouTube thinks I’m talking about one of the newer ones. Like I said before this is a pretty good laptop but it’s so outdated and I can barely get any games on here. Like I got steam the other day but steam barely even have fun games that supports macOS. (Just in case anybody wanted to know about downloading steam). This is my review on this laptop.",

This one is amazing. Keys are like butter and battery has lasted over a week on 1st charge. I'm so grateful for this company actually taking the time to correctly refurbish and quality control their products. I highly recommend this seller. Best refurber so far. Thanks so much, I'll buy again around Thanksgiving for a Christmas present.",

Pero se supone que un producto reacondicionado como \"Excelente\" viene con la pila a un 80% pero veo con una pila que no dura ni 3 horas y sale una viso de atención para revisar la pila. Asó que lleve la compu a la tienda Apple y la pila original más el servicio sale mas caro que el valor del la compra. Osea, eso que es una venta de la mera plataforma Amazon, revisada, categorizada y \"garantizada\" por ellos. En resumo, es uma trampa y no sé como Amazon te vende una mentira. Además no te explican que si a caso quieres hacer devolución ellos te devuelven 1800 pesos a menos del valor que pagaste la compu. Osea, las nuevas politicas ahora benefician solo a Amazon, es totalmente un desastre. Nuevo dueño, nuevas reglas. No lo compren.",

Man was I shocked! This mouse is pretty accurate! It is comfortable to hold, and I have not fatigue using it for hours on end. I even tried gaming with it, which was a awesome experience. I also have more desk space now! Since this mouse doesn't require a mouse pad to track! Also the mouse buttons are not annoying loud, like on mouse \"gaming mice\".Pros:- Comfortable over long periods of time- Tracks well enough for gaming- Quite clicks- No mouse-pad requiredCons:- Mouse acceleration will need to be enabled (it helps when constantly lifting the mouse while gaming)- Right click button on the left side is a little hard to press- No middle clickWhat I would like to see in the future:- Upgraded sensor... like a pix-art sensor- Lighter to press right click- Rubber grips- Higher Pulling rate- Middle click- Include AAA Battery",

Guessing did not help when initially not working.First one I ordered only worked for a few minutes. Did not work the next day.Button positions felt uncomfortable/unnatural. Seems like the left-click button (top front) was too high. I felt I had to bend my finger way back to use the scroll wheel - did not feel natural. The right-click button (left side) did not feel comfortable to press.Second one I ordered worked for a whole day. Easier set up. I just plugged in the USB adapter, started working. I got a little more comfortable using the buttons. But on the second day I used it, did not work. Was getting very warm. Put in new battery, worked for a few minutes, but got warm again. My guess is that something inside was shorting out the battery.I might have liked it had I used it for a couple of days. But it did not last that long.I do not recommend getting this.",

    "reviewText": "NB the documentation does not say this, but the pen actually works better if you use it in the stand.The device is very light. It feels flimsy, but maybe the light weigh is good as it may be easier on the handI was interested in this, because the previous mouse I was using was irritating the arthritis in my right thumb. I am hoping this will be better, but it might be too soon to tell. In any case, it's generally better to switch up hand positions to relieve repetitive use injuries.It did not come with a battery. The battery cover was hard to remove. I had a friction sheet that I use for opening jars. That helped me open the battery cover.The battery was hard to get in, but eventually I did.At first the laptop did not recognize the clicks on this mouse -- but then it seemed to figure it out. Maybe there's a learning curve -- not sure.Otherwise it seems to work.I'll have to get back to this review after I see whether it helps my hand feel betterOne disadvantage is that I use the mouse on a pull out drawer, below the surface of my workstation. This device is too tall to stay on the drawer when I close it.-----------------I've been using it for 2 days now. I've knocked it on the floor at least 20 times during that time. So far, it's still working, but I wonder how long it can survive like this. A lot of times I accidentally knock it on the floor when I'm trying to reach for it. Other times, it's because I forget it's there. It's very unstable.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased this after seeing an embroidery digitizer use it in a video online. One of the well-known digitizing software companies even recommends it on its site. While the reviews online seem to vary, I figured at this price it was worth a shot.It arrived quickly. The packaging is okay, though if it had been included in a box with something heavy, I would have concerns about it being protected well enough.The instructions it came with were insufficient at best. They basically say to insert a battery, plug in the dongle to your computer, and the pen will automatically connect as it was paired at the factory. There are no markings on the inside of the pen or in the instructions to tell you which direction to insert the battery.Despite our technical knowledge, neither my husband nor I were able to get this pen to connect to any computer in our household. The wireless mouse I purchased the same day worked just fine though, so that leads me to believe it was a problem with the pen.Holding the pen felt unnatural to me. It's oddly shaped, probably for ergonomics, but it fails in this way.Perhaps others have had better luck, but this is going back and I'll have to do further research on a digital pen.",

    "reviewText": "What a great pen mouse! My only difficulty was using it on \"whatever\". It doesn't respond well on every type of surface or materal. HOWEVER, I suggest just using the palm of your hand if possible. It's super accurate when used this way! For reference, we just use it to get streaming services and movies started and then put it up so our 4 year old can't get it. Palm of the hand is preferable in that situation. lol",

    "reviewText": "I got this mouse to switch between 3 machines. I've been using the ProtoArc keyboard for about 6 months and like it a lot. Now my workflow is more complicated and being able to switch without changing peripheral devices is a huge upgrade. Fortunately everything else about this mouse works well for my preferences. The angle option is nice. I use the 20 degree tilt. (Note to ProtoArc: it would be nice if you could lock it at 20 degrees.) It's a very comfortable angle and the button placement is fine for my hand (medium-large). The trackball is smooth and the DPI options are easy to change for various tasks. Clicks are silent yet definite. The surfaces are pleasing and do not seem like they'll collect grime. Everything feels well planned both ergonomically and for producrivity.I have two minor complaints: 1) [UPDATE 6/10/24: I may not have given this mouse a complete charge when I first got it. It's lasting me 5 or 6 days of heavy use now.] The battery life is short. It got me thru a very full workday—about 8 hours of actual use time. The next morning it died after about an hour. Easy to charge at my desk, but if ProtoArc could double or triple the battery life then it would match other brands in longevity. 2) A quiker wakeup and reconnect would be nice. It's not bad. And with the capability to connect with three devices it's hard to complain. But if ProtoArc can solve these 2 issues I think they could take over a big chunk of the peripheral market. Even with these minor criticisms I will confidently rate this mouse and the matching keyboard as 5 star devices. ProtoArc is a company on the rise.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Replace your old trackball with this one or just make the switch from a mouse",
    "reviewText": "I ordered it, I plugged the little USB dongle in, turned it on and it worked right out of the box. I was astonished. Not that it worked, but that it was so much better than my previous trackball. It's so slick and precise and the smooth button clicks made my old trackball seem like a brick dipped in glue.I prefer trackballs to mice and most are pretty similar ergonomically, but they managed to improve on that with the tilt feature. Most trackballs appear to be the same, but this one is hands down above the rest. I may or may not use the feature, but I can definitely see the benefit of it being able to switch between three different computers, using the wireless for one and Bluetooth for the other two. The button for switching between computers seems like it is in an odd place and vulnerable to unintentional clicking, but that's not the case. It's conveniently located without being in the way. Being able to adjust DPI at the touch of a button is pretty handy too, allowing for increased precision when required. This button is also conveniently located without the potential of accidentally changing the setting. The RGB lighting is a cool feature with a number of pattern options, but really has no functional purpose that I'm aware of. I'm happy with cool though. The lights will shut off automatically after about 30 seconds of non use in order to save power. Of course, it comes with a charging cable. What more is there to say? Oh, yeah, I even like that textured surface under your palm. This one's a winner!",

The ball movement isn't as smooth but not far enough off to be much of a factor. The covering is slippery, sometimes I feel like it's going to slip away, the Logitech had actual grip to it. Battery life is about half. Often lags when switching between devices. The plastic base has me afraid I might accidentally snap, feels half as sturdy as the Logitech.Works well enough for the price, though if this craps out in the same amount of time as the Logitech then I'll probably shell out the little extra for the MX.",

    "reviewText": "My wife and I have both been using the Logitech M570 trackball (and it's various ancestors) for decades. Each and every single one would typically last approximately 2.5-3 years, at which point the left mouse button would begin to add in random additional clicks when used. This happened again, last week.Normally, I avoid off-brand products like the plague. I have rarely had even acceptable experiences with them - generally, the experiences were terrible. Amazon's return policy, however, offers me a bit of flexibility when it comes to product selection. With this in mind, when I happened to see this item, sporting a 20% discount (bringing the price down to $39.99), I figured, \"Why not?\" I am SO glad I did!This trackball is excellent! Construction, battery life (so far), setup - all were exemplary. If you are in the market for a new/replacement trackball, I highly recommend you give this one a shot. You will be pleasantly surprised.Pros:Quality construction - the plastic feels solid and the trackball as a whole has a nice \"heft\" to it.No extraneous software needed - the trackball works as a plug and play mouse. The RGB ring around the ball is controlled via a 5-setting push-button (4 color patterns + Off).Rechargeable built-in battery (USB-C) - No scouring the junk drawer for AA or AAA batteries.Battery Life - I've been using mine heavily for four days and still have 43% charge remaining.Connectivity - This trackball can be connected to a max of three devices at a time; one via the (included) 2.4 GHz receiver and two via Bluetooth. Switch between devices with the touch of a button.Comfort - trackball can be used in a flat position or at a 20-ish degree tilt to the right.CONS:No direct control of the RGB ring: there are 4 color patterns and off - that's it. While this doesn't bother me, it may be an issue for some users.The scroll wheel has a very tight, crisp movement between clicks. I find this perfect, my wife does not.",

    "reviewText": "This review is for the Adesso iMouse S8. I was looking for the smallest wired mouse that still has a DPI switch button. I believe this is one of the only mice that fits into that category.The Adesso S8 is a small and light weight mouse with a retractable cord. It is very comfortable to use with my medium sized hands. I used a much smaller Verbatim Traveler mouse and it was just too difficult to control. I did notice less strain on my wrists and elbows with this mouse over other much larger mice that I have used in the past. However, this is a benefit based on the size class as opposed to this mouse in particular. I do have a few issues with the Adesso S8.The main problem I have with the Adesso S8 is the build quality. The Adesso is light because it is made out of very thin plastic with the inside having a lot of empty space. The retractable cord is thinner than any mouse cord that I have ever seen or used before. That might be acceptable if retracting the cord was not so tricky. Even the buttons and scroll wheel have that cheap feel to it. Some more metal or thicker plastic would have improved build quality and added some much needed heft to it. For me, the light weight makes it a bit difficult to control. Another thing is that I have seen other mice with a very similar design and look to this one. So, this is probably a generic mouse that Adesso just puts a name on.Overall, this is a comfortable mouse that actually has 4 DPI settings. I would prefer a mouse with a little more weight to it. I do not believe this mouse would last that long given its flimsy build quality. In the end the price does seem to match the quality of mouse that you get.Note: Amazon.com does not allow half ratings. But if I could I would give it 3.5 out of 5.",

The mouse is comfortable and is working OK. If more information had been available, I might have given it another star.",

    "reviewText": "I like this mouse and it works well. I just don't think a regular size mouse like this one should be on a retractable cable.I feel like I should have gotten the mini size mouse on a retractable cable. I say this because of the weight of a regular size mouse doesn't allow the cable to pull back together on its own. I have to monkey with it quite a bit to get it back together when I'm finished with it each time, which can get a bit aggravating sometimes. Unless paired with a stronger retractable cable, I would recommend the Mini size mouse because of this issue.",

    "reviewText": "** quick update to my review: I expected to write this update a few weeks ago, when they batteries finally ran out, so I could comment on how long they lasted. Then another week passed without them running out. Then another. AND ANOTHER. I've used this keyboard for well over a month now (closer to 6 weeks, actually) and FINALLY this morning the lights started flashing to let me know it needed a charge. I'm extremely impressed with the life on this! I'm not using it for 8+ hours every day, but I did use it for at least 1-2 hours most days. Absolutely recommend this keyboard, no hesitation.I've been using an older, full-size Apple \"Magic Keyboard\" for the last 5+ years, which has given me quite a bit of \"muscle memory\" when it comes to typing. When my old keyboard finally died, I went looking for a replacement that was full sized, wireless, had the apple keyboard layout, and wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. There's not actually all that many options that check all of those boxes, but I was fortunate enough to find this one.When it arrived, I tried absolutely everything I could think of to get it into pairing mode and just couldn't make it happen. I ended up reading through Macally's website and then calling their support department, and after walking through some troubleshooting with me they determined the bluetooth module was bad. Since I bought it on Amazon they said I could either return it here and order a new one, or process an RMA directly through them. The downside to doing it through them was that it \"might take a bit longer to get to you\" since they obviously don't have Amazon's logistics infrastructure, but they didn't require me to send it back to them either. I filled out a short RMA form via email, and a few days later my brand new keyboard arrived via UPS. I think it only ended up being one, maybe two days longer wait at most.Now, not only do I have a working keyboard again, they sent me the most recent model (USB-C charging instead of micro-usb) too! Pairing this new one took me all of 10 seconds, and it's been working great ever since.They keyboard doesn't feel \"quite\" as good as my old Apple keyboard, but the difference is negligible and absolutely not worth paying literally 3x more for. If my old keyboard was a 10, this is a solid 9.5. I'm entirely happy with it.I haven't used it long enough to comment on battery life or longevity yet, but given how easy it was to resolve a problem with them I'm not worried about either.I'd absolutely recommend this for anyone looking to replace a magic keyboard (or to avoid paying 3x the cost to buy one in the first place)!",

It's a great keyboard with one glaring problem -- the battery dies very quickly. Even though I've started keeping it connected to a charger and turn it off when I'm not using it, the battery does seem to last more than a few hours at most. In fact, this morning when I turned if on it was already dead and it took a while to charge enough to connect to my Mac. The battery is a huge disappointment to what would otherwise be a great keyboard.",

They also responded within 12 hours of me sending my email and shipped the replacement asap! One of the best customer service experiences I’ve ever had with any electronic item I own.The keyboard is great as a Mac user, I love how I can change the Bluetooth signal to use on my work computer and personal computer it makes it so much easier and typing is very quiet, it’s small enough to take to travel, and lightweight",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The keyboard hardware is very well built, while it is made of plastic, the artificial weights inside it makes it feel premium. I also think the keypresses has a more premium feeling compared to Apple's keyboard. However, they put many software hacks on this keyboard to try to achieve the function row functionality, which causes the following problems:1. Pressing F5 does not start dictation, instead it brings up Spotlight, it is same as pressing F4 button.2. F6 key does not start Do Not Disturb on Mac, instead it puts Mac to sleep.3. The Fn key is not sending the Fn key event. I have the Fn key set to bring up Emoji panel, but pressing it only changes the input method for me.4. Pressing fn + F1, F2…etc does not input F1 F2..etc key press, instead it is still performing multimedia functions such as brightness & volume.Details of the software hacks of this keyboard:The Fn button is not sending the Fn key event, so I can't use the Fn key to bring up the emoji panel, instead it is sending a hardcoded Control + Space keypress event to switch input methods. Same for F3 and F4 keys, they sending hardcoded keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Command + Space) to bring up Spotlight or Mission Control, if you customized the keyboard shortcuts in MacOS, some of the function row keys will no longer work. Since the Fn key is programmed to send Control + Space keypresses, you can not input F1 to F12 by pressing Fn + the function row keys, so if you need to input F1 to F12, then you have to look for other keyboards.I really hope they can fix the software on this keyboard, I have one docking station and 2 MacBooks, I bought this keyboard so that I can use the 2.4Ghz adapter to connect this keyboard to my docking station, so I don't have to switch keyboards when switching between my 2 MacBooks on my docking station.Upon reaching out to the seller about the problems above, the seller is very apologetic and offered a refund, huge kudos to the excellent customer service!",

Love that it has more than just a boring white or black color to choose from. Have been having this keyboard for a while now and using it everyday. We have a lot of keyboards and I always come back to this one because it types so well. Love it so much we bought more just in case it quits working we then have extra to replace it. With this great price, it is so worth it. Also it looks very identical to the apple Magic Keyboard-almost the same except for that it doesn’t have the fingerprint sensor. All in all we are very pleased with this keyboard and highly recommend it.",

    "reviewText": "I needed a spare keyboard for a couple of my production Macs. This keyboard feels and works almost as good as an Apple keyboard! I was a bit amazed at just how good it is! While I'm not a \"typist\", I do a lot of media production and this is a great unit for a couple of my auxiliary Macs. One of the nice features is that you don't have to (it's optional) use the typical Bluetooth connection that can connect/disconnect at times, but in addition to Bluetooth also has a USB module that provides a 2.4GHz USB-A channel for immediate and reliable wireless connection. In addition, unlike so many 3rd party keyboards, this actually has Mac keys like CMD, the top row keys, etc. Looks Mac also and the keys feel pretty danged good, especially for the money!",

    "reviewText": "Was a little worried about buying refurb, but for the price of $70, I figured there wasn’t much to lose, especially since it could always be returned. The item arrived in “like new” condition. Packaging, accessories and the keyboard itself are all in clean, flawless condition. Fired up straight out of the box and connected immediately to my MacBook Pro and my iPad without any issue. As for the experiencing using the keyboard itself, this is my first mechanical keyboard and I find the typing experience to be pleasant. To be honest though, the novelty of the loud clicking (even though this is a “quiet” mechanical), while fun at first, began to wear off after about an hour. I started to experiment on how to strike the keys to make the strokes as quiet as possible. While switching back and forth between the MX Mechanical, MX Keys, and my MacBook Pro’s keyboard, I find I much prefer the scissor switches, but I will keep the mechanical around switch it up every now and then. If the MX Mechanical Mini is what you want, don’t hesitate on buying refurb and saying a lot of money. If the item you get doesn’t meet expectations, you can always send it back and try again.Edit - 3/9/24. After using the Mechanical Mini exclusively for a couple of days, I’m much more “used” to it, both he feel and the sound, and am starting to prefer it to the MX Keys. I still enjoy the built in keyboard on my MacBook Pro the most, but the mechanical mini is not far behind.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great keyboard. One oddity. UPDATE 5/27/2024",
    "reviewText": "I order this keyboard, but a bigger keyboard and a $100 logitech keyboard. This is smaller than I thought it would be, but that isn't really bad. Yes, it would be a little easier if there was a row of buttons for the shortcuts instead of requiring everything to be a combo or triple combo press. But, it works good, the keys have a nice feel, it is easy to type on and the keys are where you expect them to be. You can turn the light brightness up and down. Plus, it has fn-lock, and an fn-lock indicator light, so you can pick whether the shortcut keys (most the F1-F12 keys) act like function keys when pressed or the shortcut keys. It comes with a manual but the instructions are also printed on the bottom of the keyboard which is a nice touch. It's very similar to a laptop keyboard. But yeah, apart from it being a little finicky when you go to pair it the first time, it's a really great keyboard. I almost never use the number pad numbers, and if I did need them for some reason, like I was playing a game, I could just switch to a different keyboard. I really don't see how a Logitech keyboard can be worth 2 1/2 times the price of this one. Granted, the Logitech comes with a dongle and this doesn't so maybe that will be an issues, but you can get a Bluetooth receiver for $10. The Logitech keyboard also comes with special software that will let you map the short keys to different keystrokes in different applications, but most applications already support shortcut key mapping, and Open Source programs like AutoHotKey and TweakKey for windows also allow you to do this for free will 100% for more more and flexibility. But yeah, I'm super happy, can't really speak on the battery life, but hopefully it is good.UPDATE 5/26/24:I didn't notice when I bought the keyboard or even when I reviewed it, but this keyboard comes with Left and Right Windows keys and No Left Ctrl. You have left and right Alt keys, but not left and right control, and a Right Windows. This makes it hard to use Photoshop and Illustrator on Windows because Ctrl++ and Ctrl+- are the default commands for zoom in and out, and if you have to use the left Ctrl key it suddenly requires 2 hands.Thankfully, there are a couple solutions. The easiest is to download Microsoft's PowerToys for Windows and go to the keyboard manager and Enable Key Remapping and then remap that key to Ctrl(left). This I have working.UPDATE:You can use a program called KeyTweak to remap keys in the Windows 10 Registry. I ended up having to do this because the keyboard doesn't have a delete and backspace button. The delete button typically works as a backspace button. You can press fn+delete to have it work as a delete button, but I need an actual delete button like my laptop keyboard has. This is the layout the Logitech MX mini uses (it costs almost $100 though).I used a program called KeyTweak to remap the PrntScreen key to delete in the Windows registry. Unfortunately, this remaps BOTH the print screen key on this keyboard, and the print screen key on my laptop.So, I have to unmap everything. Restart my computer, then map fn+PrintScreen (my laptop's \"Insert key\") to PrintScreen. Then map PrintScreen to delete. Then remap Left Windows Key to Left Control. And now it works the way I want, except I have to press fn when I press PrintScreen on my laptop, and I no longer have an Insert key, but I literally haven't used an insert key in probably 20 years.The reason I dropped my review to 4 stars is because the wireless keyboard seems to sometimes send double keys, or it will go to sleep (even when plugged in), and then it will miss a key, and then I'll hit it again, and then it will double send the key it missed + the new key. It's literally 6 inches from my laptop, and I wanted to see if I shut off bluetooth and just used USB-C if it would still mess up, but you can't shut off bluetooth and just plug it in :( So I'm dropping my review to 4 stars, mostly for the buggy keys but also because it lacks the option to work as a non-wireless keyboard. If it just worked good, I wouldn't mind having to rebind the keys, but missing keys and losing keys while typing it a big PITA, especially because I code. It isn't mess up enough to really warrant sending it back, it's maybe like 1 in 1000 keystrokes it messes up -- if it was any less I'd probably just think it was user error, but I've been typing a very long time and I can tell when I type something correctly and the keyboard tosses in an extra letter. Even just typing this sentence, it added an extra c in correctly and an extra s at the end of this and I had to go back and fix them.",

The backlighting is super bright. It comes with an extra year warranty. Rechargeable battery with lots of shortcut features including home button and screenshot. I would loved to see this in black with the white keys. No cons only pros at the moment. I highly recommend this keyboard.",

I tried the Macally full size USB keyboard I had for my Mac Mini but it was too cumbersome, the key travel is too long and it lacked backlighting. The SATECHI is compact and the key travel is very close to the same as the MacBook Pro and the backlighting works well.I purchase the SATECHI mouse at the same time. The mouse connector is quite a bit longer than the keyboard connector and doesn't fit as snuggly in the port. (see image) The mouse works OK but I prefer the feel and responsiveness of my Microsoft mini laser mouse.The cables for both the mouse and keyboard are pretty stiff which means they don't lay flat and look a messy on the desk.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Nicely sized wired keyboard with sensitive keys",
    "reviewText": "I generally like this keyboard for its size and weight (it's sturdy enough, but not as sturdy as an Apple keyboard). In my pics you can see it's fairly thin and it features backlighting, if you want that (you can turn it off).I prefer a wired keyboard due to better response time and avoiding connection or battery issues, so I got this one. Overall I'm OK with it, but the keys are a bit too sensitive and have weak spring stiffness to them. During rapid typing, you can easily overtype a key and I find myself frequently hitting delete to edit typing errors that don't happen on my Apple keyboard at home. For this review I'm using my Apple keyboard and I've managed to avoid having to delete extra letters. If I was using the Satechi keyboard, I would've had to hit delete maybe 10 times by now. It can get annoying, but it's not a complete make or break sort of thing.After 7 months of use, my keyboard has a little fading on heavy use keys, but it's not glaring and you can't really tell in my pics. I like that the keys are black so I can avoid the nasty dirtied up look white keyboards easily get.",

    "reviewText": "I received a replacement and that unit suffers the same problem with improper de-bounce. so you get lots of duplicated key-presses. A google search reveals a Macworld article titled \"Satechi Aluminum Bluetooth Keyboard with Numeric Keypad review: A good Magic Keyboard alternative\" Quote: //Keystrokes would sometimes repeat, making typing all but impossible. I found I could eradicate those issues on a PC if I kept it plugged in, but I had no such luck on a Mac. And at any rate, keeping a Bluetooth keyboard plugged in kind of defeats the point of a Bluetooth keyboard.//I HAVE THE WIRED W1 VERSIONIT\"S IMPOSSIBLE TO USE BECAUSE OF KEY PRESS DUPLICATION .I contacted Satechi support and they replied that this device is only compatible with a 2018 or later Mac thunderbolt port, and I didn't read the fine print carefully. Yet Satechi offers a type-C to type-A adapter!According to Satehchi, it's completely reasonable to require committing a 20 gigabit/s I/O port to a 5 bit/s keyboard and my-bad for misunderstanding how this technology works. Also, USB3 is not backwards compatible with previous USB, except when Satechi sells the converter?For fun, I tried it connecting these devices a to a PC type-C USB port and it caused an over-current condition and shut the port down.I am sending the original back to Amazon in exchange for this replacement, and I'm throwing the replacement in the trash and eating the $60 cost.Live and learn.* * *(This is typed on a Satechi Slim W1)Problem with inadequate de-bounce means lots of dupllicate characters. How cann the problem of de-bounce still not bee be solved!! Did I inntend to type these dups? Or is the keyboard adding them on itss own?Too bad because the kkeybooard iss very good ootherwise.Excellent mmaterials and quality feel.Apple layout with helpful labelling of alt/opt key for Windows part time usse.Stable feet are properly grippy.Backlight is excelllent. Note that the backlight adjustment keys are in the Apple standard location but do not inntegrate with the Apple keyboard driver. The backlight adjustment is handled internally in 4 appropriately spaced steps. BBut this also meanns that 'fn' kkey functionnality is not Apple compatible. These are minor compprommisses.Too bad about debounce nnot working properly. This is an literally an '80s PC problem!",

It works on all other devices extremely well and accurately! I saw other buyers having issues with the smaller keys by the folding portions, but with a little familiarization, it's not a problem and you adjust quickly! This device honestly makes it easier to type on tablets with oversized keyboards, or cell phones with the infamous \"thisnisbwhat happensbwhen Intype\" design flaw. I highly recommend this device! My only suggestion on product improvement, is the ability to lock into a flat form while unfolded... the outward curve is a little odd when resting in your lap.Customer service for this company is great, by the way! They addressed my issues promptly and offered me a refund, but a refund is not necessary... it just took a little product familiarization. Great buying experience overall! They've 100% earned my respect and will buy from them again!",

    "reviewText": "Amazon is the wild west of retail. I enjoy the freedom to choose, but can be a mixed bag. This little keyboard is one of the good ones. There's nothing like it with more well-known brands.It's perfect for more my use-case. I wanted something small to tuck out of the way when not in use to control a mini PC behind a monitor that will be running a PowerPoint on a loop. I'll only occasionally need to interact with the PC. This keyboard connected with zero issues and even wakes the PC from sleep via Bluetooth.I'm kinda a keyboard snob and thought even the keystroke travel felt decent especially for the size.The only issue I found is there isn't a dedicated 'esc' key (it's an alt function of a shared key), it wasn't working while in a PowerPoint presentation.Overall, I'd happily use this over a touchscreen keyboard on a tablet for heavier typing tasks. I'm using it with a Stick PC. You could carry around a full desktop version of Windows capable PC literally in your pocket. The future isn't all bad.",

Long battery life, (can get through at least 2 work sessions with out having to recharge). It is a little harder to use in a lap because of the folds and most stable on a solid surface but it’s overall a great little keyboard and the track pad has little to no lag in my experience.",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Ultra Slim Bluetooth Keyboard, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. This keyboard has turned my son’s ipad into a laptop and enabled me to actually get some work done while he is doing his homework.Key Features:*Quiet - the keys don’t clack loudly, which is great for using in public places*Slim profile - perfect for tablets*Great connectivity - don’t have to worry about wires and stays connected via bluetoothQuality:The build quality is nothing extraordinary, but it feels solid for how little I paid for it. It is pretty thin, which is a positive and something I wanted, but also means it does have a flimsy feel. However, I’m not worried that my teenage son will be carrying it around and using it for school. I think it will hold up just fine.Performance:I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. So far it has not lost connectivity and I haven’t had to charge it yet, which means it has held it’s charge for over a week of use.Design:My son loves the sleek design. It’s so thin, thinner than I realized through the item description. The colorful keys is a nice touch and adds a bit of personality. It’s also just wide enough for an ipad, but the keys still feel comfortable—there’s enough space between the keys to make typing feel natural.Ease of Use:One of the standout features is how user-friendly it is. Even for someone like my son who is not tech-savvy, this Ultra Slim Bluetooth Keyboard was easy to set up and use right out of the box.Value for Money:Considering the quality, performance, and design, this bluetooth keyboard offers exceptional value for money. It was so cheap I was afraid it would not last long, but after using it for awhile, I feel confident it will serve us well.Conclusion:In conclusion, I highly recommend the Ultra Slim Bluetooth Keyboard to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality, small bluetooth keyboard.",

    "reviewText": "I have to say, for the price I really wasn't expecting much. However, much to my surprise it works surprisingly well. It charges real quick, as in less than an hour via the included USB cord (wish there was a charging block, but apparently most products don't come with them anymore). Size is great as it can slip into a pouch of a briefcase, or a womans purse realitively easy. Buttons seem to be well made and the spring under the keys isn't too stiff, but not weak either. Connecting the keyboad to the table was simple, press the \"connect\" button on the keyboard and then locate it on the Bluetooth device screen on your tablet. Eazy Peazy.There is however sitll the need to hit the send button on the screen. But thats really just a minor inconvience. One question I'm sure people are wondering is \"Is there a lag time between when a button is pressed and when the letter shows up on the screen?\". I can honestly say that I can not see any lag between the two devices.Final thoughts:For less than $15, you really can't go wrong with this keyboard if you use a tablet a lot instead of a PC or Laptop PC. Its much nicer than using your finger on the screen to be honest, or at least it is for me. For whatever reason my Tablet seems to struggle keeping up with keystrokes on the touch screen.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this keyboard for my iPad because I like to review books, and it was just too much to use the screen keyboard, and not worth turning on a PC for. So far it works great. Easy to pair with just one button, portable, magnetic. I recommend getting a case that can hold the keyboard and prop the iPad though as typing in your lap is a little cumbersome. There is a tiny delay between typing and the letters on the screen so make sure you dont just glide over the keys. Otherwise for $12 I love it!",

Fit inside the the cover. Was not sure whether I needed it or not and absolutely did not want to take anything I absolutely did not need. Once set up it felt like a laptop and less like a mobile device. Touch typing vs look at a screen is really nice. Touchscreen and keyboard felt a bit awkward at first but after a while it felt very smooth and seamless. Moments when you can close your eye and just type is priceless. Not regret buying it and bringing along",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The keyboard looks sturdy and well-built. It has a sleek design and pairs well with the size of the iPad.Keys are very responsive, with a comfortable amount of travel and tactile feedback. The keys are more closer to each other compared to a traditional keyboard, but more easy to use compared to the inbuilt keyboard.The keyboard is compatible with my iPad annd the connectivity was seamless. It connects via Bluetooth and has a charging cable, no need to buy an additional battery.It doesn’t have for backlighting or adjustable viewing angles but still worth the money we spend.The charging was pretty quick, but the cable is very short.It is very slim and portable. Slim and lightweight designs make it easier to carry the keyboard along with the iPad.This is a budget-friendly option that provide decent performance. I bought this for my son, to help him with increasing the typing speed and looks like it works perfect for his little hands.Overall, it is a compact, easy to connect and cheaper option available online.",

I couldn't interact with it to type anything in. So I need wired keyboard with the touch pad. This one is that much better because it can be both wireless AND wired. I LOVE THIS. I hooked the USB end to a additional USB-C to USB adapter since my cell uses the USB-C for charging. This worked perfectly! I can now use a keyboard and mouse with my cell phones!!!! Still waiting on my replacement cell!",

Keyboard area is a little smaller to accommodate the touchpad, but it doesn't feel cramped. The touchpad is not responsive enough though, it doesn't seem well-configured to be honest. It's good!! Just not great yet. But overall, if this does what you need, it will definitely be a good choice :)",

The signal and angles are frustrating to accurize because if I am at a slightly poor angle: no signal. The biggest travesty is the touchpad. No way to disable touch to click and no way to invert scrolling (it scrolls opposite to a normal laptop touchpad). I cannot believe this has any good reviews and hope to deter anyone from buying one of these in the future.",

I had enough spare parts lying around to setup a debugging kiosk for students to load their code on a big screen, except the stand couldn't hold both a standard keyboard and mousepad. This little gem from Vilros was all I needed. Apart from hunting around for keys like insert and delete, it's been smooth sailing. I wouldn't want this as my main keyboard for composing long essays on a routine basis, but if space is at a prime, you won't go wrong with this choice. It's also nice that you can swap between wired and wireless. Most little keyboards are wireless only, but the Vilros model lets you go wired so you never run into a dead battery.",

I use CTRL-Y often and not having the CTRL on the same side as the Y makes it a 2-handed move, not 1-hand.2) The Delete button is right next to the Bluetooth button. I'm constantly accidently clicking the 2.4G Bluetooth button and disconnecting the keyboard. Wish there wasn't a button right next to Delete, woudl be easier to \"find\" without looking.Again, other than those two little things, it works great.",

The keyboard is compact so it will save desk space. Otherwise, this is a fairly nice, good quality keyboard, comes with a dongle for the wireless connection to the keyboard and a charging cable. HOWEVER, the customer service at this store is superb! I did not only get instructions on the use of the keyboard, they accepted my return and refund, they also offered me an option of repaying me back the money again for my troubles or replacing the keyboard for free. I was completely floored by their treatment! So even though this keyboard wasn’t for me, I would still recommend it since it was a nice little keyboard!",

This keyboard arrived quickly and was well packaged and so easy to hook up and was already charged! The keys are smooth but the best feature is the wrist rest. It is very soft. I do feel like the keyboard should be able to be adjusted higher. When you lift the tabs on the back to make the keyboard higher to give a better slant, the increase is minimal. The reason I am returning it is because the keyboard shortcuts on the Mac are not the same. The keyboard is really labeled for a PC but they added some additional stickers like it can do both but Command + V gets you nowhere. Total deal breaker.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Good, but missing critical keys",
    "reviewText": "Overall I quite like this keyboard. Key feel is firm and responsive, well separated, and slightly concave, making it easy to feel. No double letters or missed spaces common to many wireless keyboards. Ergonomics are not bad and tilt legs help customise to preference.Minor qualms are that the ergonomic curve is pretty flat, so it's not particularly ergonomic. The legs on the front are too short - I'd prefer to have it tilted more aggressively backwards like my MS Ergonomic keyboard. I also dislike the up/down arrow keys being minimised and centered. The upper arrow **needs** to be above the side arrows, even if slightly. I use arrow keys a lot for moving around spreadsheets and documents and this makes it unnecessarily challenging. It makes far more sense to make the left/right arrows smaller instead.I can live with these as this is a secondary keyboard that floats around the house when I mix up my work space. However, two critical dedicated keys are missing from this keyboard - the home and end keys, which I use constantly. Yes, you can use them as alternative keys on the num pad, but I'm often also entering numbers, so it's frustrating to keep switching it on and off. I notice the absence of these frequently every time I use this board.These keys could be in place of the source switching keys above the numpad, and those could've been shrunk and located in the empty space in the middle of the keyboard under the indicator lights. With this layout it would be a 5 star product. As it stands, it's more of a 3.5.",

It also has a 2.4G connector with the connector dongle attached to the keyboard by a small magnetic holder! First time I've ever seen that. Very cool. I'm always losing these things.The keys are indented. This helps me find key centers without looking at the keyboard. The default angle of the keyboard is great and there is a satisfying dull click of completion on the keys when you are typing. You can feel when the key has engaged to send the letter to your computer. It's almost like a key press validation sensation.The only thing I would change would be to add a calculator button just because I use the calculator a lot. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.",

My only complaint is that the hyphen and underline keys are in strange places, which really doesn't seem necessary, but as those keys aren't used very often (by me anyway), it's not an issue. If you need a portable keyboard for your phone or tablet, this is it! The phone/tablet stand works well, and the whole thing feels fairly sturdy. I wouldn't stuff it in an overpacked backpack and carry it through a crowd, but for everyday use it's perfect.Be aware that you'll need a flat surface to set it up. Unlike other keyboards that you could use, say, in the car or in a waiting room, resting on your knees, this one requires a table or something solid.",

I 100% agree with her; not only have I been using it for writing short stories on my phone, but also for balancing my checking account (they keyboard attached to my iPad has stopped working, but I still use it as a stand).",

    "reviewText": "I purchased two different USB keyboards to try out, and found myself absolutely loving this little foldout. The design on this is brilliant, keyboard layout is natural and just large enough to allow for comfortable, rapid typing. It's attractive, even cute with an almost toy-like feel. It works well and connectivity is simple and assured.Wishlist: It is plastic and not aluminum as listed. I would pay more for something built a bit more ruggedly with metal case and hinges. I like it enough to care. The foldout phone shelf: great idea! I wish it were deep enough to accommodate my phone in its case. I purchased a phone holder separately as a result.Overall, the design is brilliant and the keyboard is very functional. I like it so much, I would love to see the product produced with long-term use in mind. I will be using this all of the time.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Mistypes. Bent key.",
    "reviewText": "I'm going to write this review without correcting any istakes made by the keyboard. I assure you, i am doing my best to type as accrately as possible,,, wih no spelling errors. Straight out of the box, the keyboard does look nice. I bought it because it looked like it was a well-made product, and i wanted to treat myself. It is very light, and I can se it on my lap without discomfort. However, the u key is bent and sometimes rfuses to type. I also notice that when I am yping at a faster pace, some letters do reepeeat. While it is trivial to correct these mistakes, it is not helpful in a live text chat situation to continuously backtrack in order to correct istakes when others are already moving on from the previous topic. The bluetooth pairng also has to be reset almost every tme I pair the device bck up (reset, n this case, meaning to forget the device from the syste's bluetooth menu), which is rather interruptive if I want to type something right t that moment. It also disconnects after some inactivity, which I did not see specified in the uuser manual as a power saving feature - it only says it is supposed to trn off when the devie is closed. I will continue to use they keyboarrrd for a week, and if these problems do not improve with time, I will retrn it. I made an attempt to contact theee seller to see if these problems could be resolved, bt I did noot find the option nywhere, strangely enough.Anyway. The keyboard looks nice and does afford some usablitity I did not ave beforee, such as the arrow keys allowing for quicker corrections to text. The keyboard itself is not excessivey noisy, nor is ittt uncomfortably small. It IS small, but not in a way that impedes my typing. Hopefully the crret problems resolve theselves, because I do like the keyboarrd. I hope the nintentional typos speak for themselves as to the qualiity. I've nly had the keyboard - inside - for a little less than a day by the tme of writinng this review.",

You should know that before purchasing - but the thing is quite fine to type on. The little flip up stand for the tablet or phone is surprisingly solid - the magnets hold on really well.As noted by others - it needs to sit on a solid base. The whole thing is hinged in the middle, so if you want something to sit on your lap, this is not it.Well worth the money for my use. Haven't played with it too much to figure out battery life, but I'm guessing the documented durations are probably on the money.",

    "reviewText": "I love the form factor and great price. Solid keyboard - 5 stars for functionality... Ok maybe 4+. However...at first the keyboard wouldn't even turn on. I thought it was the batteries and after two sets I kept monkeying with the connections of the battery holder....and it finally turned on. Fine - no problem. Stuff like that happens. That's when realized the on-off light glows red...not green? Hmm - So - I read the ultra-brief 4-page 3 x 5 directions and it doesn't describe the three LED lights on the upper right of the keyboard. I have no idea what two of them do or what they should indicate. The instructions indicate that one of the lights will blink on and off if the battery is low. Mine was steady red. and is labeled \"1\". Not on or off but \"1\". What does \"1\" mean? Who knows. There are some instructions for the alt function keys - and the keyboard seems to work fine. For me - it has a great feel. It's just annoying that the engineers did a fine job - but the marketing guys couldn't put together better instructions. Even weirder - who ever thought we'd ever need instructions for a simple keyboard??? Also - there is an addition to the numerical pad on the key board \"00\". It's where the \"0\" normally is....so - you'll have to get used to that if you are used to using a keypad.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Smooth typing keyboard - perofrms like higher priced ones.",
    "reviewText": "This keyboard feels like it is much more expensive than it really is. Here’s the breakdown:Pros: - Stylish: Rounded keys are a nice touch: sets it apart from other standard keyboards. - Low profile keys: fast actuation of switches - not great for heavy handed people, though. - Ability to have a solid backlight (not patterned) - a plus for me. - Quiet keys: not silent, but not clicky. Similar to Brown switches. - Has an on/off switch that is easily accessible. - Dedicated media control knob and buttons: volume up/down, play, pause, forward, back. - When taking photos, this keyboard's LED's were not flickering like my other keyboard. Better quality?Cons: - Key font is thin: Light coming through is not as bright as others. - Light feel: other mechanical keyboards are heavier, with a good heft. - Kickstand is not very high: approx. 5°-7° Not bad, but since it has low profile keys, the angle feels much lower. - The volume knob is small (10mm dia.) and feels a bit wobbly. - If you are not great at keyboarding, you may unintentionally activate other keys b/c of the lower profile. - Rounded keys are spaced closer together than standard square ones (approx. 1/8” or 3mm) versus my standard keyboard (approx. 1/4” or 6.5mm). Novices (like me) are bound to occasionally hit 2 keys at once.Photos show my current keyboard and my new ProtoArc (rounded keys). For the record, the lights show up brighter than they really are in the photos and they are on the maximum brightness level. I took some photos with the backlight off to show the actual font thickness compared to my old keyboard.Overall, a great keyboard for the price with a good, fluid feel.08/12/24:This is not a deal breaker, but I have one more \"con\". This keyboard does not \"sync up\" with my other ProtoArc USB dongles that I have (2 track ball mice). In other words, I need to have all 3 USB dongles connected to my laptop hub for all of my ProtoArc accessories to work. I wish they would have a system that allows all accessories to connect with each others' USB plugs - like Logitech. As I said, not a deal breaker, but it would free up some USB ports.",

    "reviewText": "Edit: Update after 10 months (2 star downgrade, then upgrade again):The keyboard starting acting up on me about 10 months into owning it and using pretty much daily for office work. Random keys started working only sporadically and no matter what I did I couldn't fix it. I ultimately contacted ProtoArc and after a little trouble shooting they ended up next-day shipping me a replacement keyboard at no charge. That's great customer service in my book and gives me confidence in buying ProtoArc products and recommending them. Buy this with confidence!Original Review:Gone through a lot of keyboards here in last few years. I'm not a gamer, but work from home full time and do a lot of typing as well as number entry. Once I tried mechanical keyboards I really liked them but found the noise, even with the quieter red switches with an extra o-ring were just too loud: any typing was clearly audible on conference calls and working at night would often wake my kids up who sleep in the next room. So I gave up and went back to a membrane keyboard (a high end one). But after a year of using that I was just never quite happy and after looking around a bit I ran across this and figured I would give it a go. Am very glad I did. I get the better typing experience of a mechancal keyboard but whatever they have done with the switches here they're definitely quieter than any other mechanical keyboard with the quietest switches available. These still make noise for sure and are louder than a membrane keyboard, but the noise is just enough to where its not disruptive. Very satisfying click and key travel is just right. I also find the orange F1-F4 keys are a nice feature: I'm in excel a lot so F2 and F4 are common use for me and while it took a little adjustment for the different spacing on this keyboard, it was quick and the keys are nice and visible even in peripheral vision so my eyes don't need to leave the screen. Battery life has been good so far for such a light (not a big battery) keyboard. I've been using daily for 2 weeks now using bluetooth connection and backlight on and have lost about 15% of charge. Backlighting is nice and keeps keys visible in low light without being distracting or harsh on the eyes. I would absolutely recommend this if you're looking for a solidly built, great typing experience, reasonably quiet, good battery life wireless mechanical keyboard. Checked all the boxes for me so I'll be keeping this one for quite a while.",

    "reviewText": "When I first got the keyboard, it was just what I wanted. I had stopped purchasing the Logitechs because of the butterfly key switches. I tried the Klim Chroma but the bluetooth connectivity was piss poor.Enter the K300.Mechanical - CheckGood connectivity - Check (More on this later)Lighted - CheckRechargeable - CheckThe one issue was that the left Ctrl key never worked properly. I had to jam it with force for it to register. Otherwise it was pretty good.A month in, it started having problems with sticky keys. I'd type a letter and it would go on forever. You could workaround this by turning off the keyboard and then turning it back on. This would work for a while and then the issue would come back. Well, over the last couple of months, it's become more and more frequent.The last straw with the keyboard started about two weeks ago. The Keyboard would go to sleep while I was using it! You'd see that the F3 would start blinking, meaning that the keyboard had lost connectivity and needed to be reconnected. The thing is, hitting the F3 key wouldn't restore connectivity. I had to literally punch the keyboard in order for it to register to reconnect. This would happen multiple times an hour. On top of that, the sticky key issue started occurring frequently too. I was done with this garbage.Thankfully, Logitech now offers exactly what I want. I hooked up my Corsair K55 while I waited for the Logitech MX Mechanical to arrive. I'm now typing this review from the Logitech. So far, so good.",

    "reviewText": "My son has hypermobile finger joints and typing on a standard keyboard was very difficult as he couldn't squish his fingers together and move them easily in normal typing posture. His teacher suggested ergonomic keyboard as his hands would have a little more space. Bought this and he's doing much better typing. It does make tap noises when keys are pressed but not annoyingly much. Setup was easy, 2 AAA batteries and he was good to go. Feels sturdy, works just as good as the one the school provided him, bought this so he can practice at home too.",

    "reviewText": "It's been several years since I last had an ergonomic keyboard, and what a difference it makes! I was avoiding typing at all since it was such a chore on the tiny little keyboards on laptops, and one that I bought because I didn't have enough room for the better version I now have. I lost the soft sounds and easy feel of pressing the keys, and, especially, the number keyboard, which I missed most of all on the other types. All-in-all, the best of keyboards is again on my desk!",

    "reviewText": "Overall, this NULEA keyboard has a nice feel to it, but it does have some issues. Quiet, but responsive feedback typing. Squishy hand rest.My main (maybe deal breaker?) complaint...The ENTER key is abnormally small & the DELETE key is abnormally long & close to the enter key! Who designed this & decided to change standard design?The round \"FN Lock\" key in the middle of the keyboard is an important button. You need to have that on if you want to use the volume or brightness buttons on a Mac. At first didn't think any of those features were working.I bought this ergonomic keyboard for home use to get the feel of ergonomic typing while waiting for the one at work to arrive. I am now using a fabulous Logitech ergo keyboard & mouse at work. The Logitech is FANTASTIC (& pricey), but it is so easy to get used to. The NULEA keyboard I'm reviewing/using is not as user friendly. I find myself hitting the wrong keys due to the enter key being smaller than any other keyboard I've ever used. The delete key is so long, right near the Enter key. So many mistakes & frustrations.",

The keyboard is surprisingly sturdy and when folded up it can withstand some force (so no need to worry about jamming it into your laptop case). The only complaint I have is that often my right pinky will rest to the right of Enter and touch the touchpad and cause a click. Would be nice if there was some sort of detection to prevent this. Either way, a top utility purchase!",

    "reviewText": "I bought this to add to a ham radio (project) that I am in the process of developing. The project is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 computer so it has Bluetooth built in which had this item up & running fast. One thing that really bothered me is the so-called instruction sheet. It leaves a lot to beg and of course covered a multitude of languages that I will never use ...One point of contention I have so far is that I cannot find a way to hold down a key and then scroll down the screen. Yes I have a touch screen but its crammed by the programming of the radio so having a way to hold down a key or pad and then use the touch pad to scroll down the page would be nice....it may well be there but I haven't found it yet in the instruction sheet (too small for my old eyes to read comfortably) ... the case is plastic and my concern is that this radio is going to be used in the field and I have to wonder how well it will hold up there .... if it were made say in titanium or aluminum that would enhance its ruggedness in a filed application.On the good side it is amazinly easy to use, very good size for my needs, and has a really great touch feel for use. The compnay was very fast to ship and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a nice portable keyboard with a number pad system ... I'm very happy with the unit.",

    "reviewText": "EDIT: After using this for a couple of weeks I removed a star because some of the keys (particularly the \"N\") are prone to not getting typed, especially when I'm using the keyboard on my lap. Also, the numeric keypad is a great idea and works in a pinch, but I almost never get all the numbers I try to type in. The keys on the lower half of the keypad have a faint, but satisfying \"click\" when you press them, but the upper two tiers have no feedack at all. And it's all too common to press numbers that don't actually get input. This gets particularly frustrating because, since there is no physical way to distinguish the keys, you have to look at the keypad to use it, meaning you will not know until you look back at the screen whether the numbers have been entered correctly, and usually they will not have been.One thing I think is missing from most videos and photos is something representing the remake size of the keyboard, so I added a couple with my medium sized hand as reference.This device is wonderful out of the box, is easy to set up with multiple devices, and the TouchPad/NumPad works extremely well.I removed one star because it doesn't snap open, so it is unstable if you rest it on your lap - tends to fold back up in on itself. But for most common uses, this is a perfect keyboard/trackpad.",
