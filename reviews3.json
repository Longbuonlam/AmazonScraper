After I put it on, it works fantastic, easily replacing the 110v pump I previously used for an upright lion fountain. The instructions did not cover the issue with the impeller cover. It’s a small part the fits inside the filter cover.",

    "reviewText": "I set up this fountain and initially it worked well. After running for about 5 minutes it stopped working. I followed the procedures in the instructions and cleaned and reset the fountain, It still did not work. I noticed a blue light was illuminated on the pump when plugged into the panel and submersed. When lifted briefly from the water the light turned red. I tried cleaning and restarting the pump numerous times with no luck. The manufacturers literature indicated that they should be contacted if there were any issued and that they would provide a satisfactory resolution within 24 hours. I sent an email to the customer service address with a detailed description of the issue, including my steps to remedy the problem. The next morning a saw a reply from them advising me to repeat the steps I had already taken. I did and responded to the email. I have not received a response and it is now beyond the 24 hour period and there appears to be no relief. I will have to return the item and order another one like I am replacing. That one lasted more than a two years in a fairly rough environment.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this to replace the pump on my bird bath in the front yard. One issue I knew going in - there's no battery as part of the system so any shading turns the pump off right away. My old one had a small battery that would keep the pump going for quite a long time after the sun was off it, or through temporary clouds.The other issue is that the shut off isn't very effective. It will eventually shut off, but many a time I've gone outside to hear the pump grinding away with no water and the pump is still just moist. Living in the South West where it is > 100F all summer my small bird bath can dry out daily so I assumed this wold cause the pump to burn out very quickly but so far it has kept going through the summer. YMMV.My previous pump was either more sensitive to the water level or the sensor was better placed, I don't know. I guess the solution for me is to bury a big reservoir of water below the bird path so it runs of out water less frequently.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. UPDATED REVIEW: I'm so disappointed that this fountain stopped working after just a bit over a month of use. I cleaned the filter and wiped down the solar panels, but nothing. So sad! Such a huge waste of money for less than 2 months of use. And how convenient that it stopped working just after the return window closed.I'm in love with this little solar fountain! I created a Japanese themed zen pond for myself using a 7 gallon livestock feed tub from a feedstore and a resin pagoda, also bought off of Amazon. After setting up the fountain I was amazed that it immediately began working when placed in the water. When the water shoots up higher and it's a windy day, you will need to refill the water more often, but that's why I chose a deep and wide livestock feed tub with 7 gallons of water. A shallow birdbath would need frequent water refills. The water sounds aren't as loud as I'd prefer, but it's peaceful to watch. But the real show begins at night! The rotating colors shining onto the moving water look like glitter! And I was impressed with how long the fountain and lights worked late into the night. I went to bed, but woke up around 1am to use the bathroom and the little fountain was still operating! Great buy! I'm so glad I spent a little more to get the night time light show!",

    "reviewText": "I bought a different one a while back but it didn't light up or hold a charge. It only works when the sun is on it. If a cloud moves over, it would turn off. So I saw this one, and I loved that it had lights. I felt the $30 price tag was too high but I really wanted to try it out. I sit out with the dogs a lot at night and I have tons of solar things all over the yard. This fountain was a waste of money. It does light up, but barely (doesn't matter that we've had nothing but straight sun with no clouds in 2 months), you can't see it unless you get right up on it and only then because you're looking down at the little bulbs. The suction is weak so it barely puts out a spray (no matter the nozzle used) and the charge only lasts about an hour after sundown. My original cheap one is much better, I get a nice size spray from the fountain. Ah well, it's like everything else ... all those bells and whistles (the lights and longer solar charge) are just a way to raise the price for less product.",

I would recommend it if you have a sunny location, I like in woods.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This little solar powered fountain works great for the money. If you’re looking for a simple and cheap fountain the different nozzles included and the pressure of the fountain will scratch that itch.-Here’s what you need to know - the pressure is dependent on how much sun the solar panel gets.-Shady? Don’t plan on your fountain working.Sunny? Your fountain will be the star of the garden.-It would be nice if there was a stored battery and an on / off switch to control when the pump ran or for when the clouds came by so the pump would continue to run.-As you will see in the video the pump is working nice, but if I step in front of the solar panel the pump stops working.If your fountain runs out of water the pump will continue to run. A shut off float would be nice, but is probably an added cost to produce.-For the money this is a good value pump. Overall I would recommend and buy again.",

It was easy to put together and no tools required. Doesn't spray much if sun is blocked by cloud or trees. Full dun would be best but it foes seem to float well and work well. It did take a couple of minutes for it to originally get pumping good.I recommend this fountain for small area pond. I love that it's solar powered",

    "reviewText": "I bought this little pump for a bird bath. It works as expected with adequate power, and the many nozzle attachments give a lot of spray possibilities. It does need to be cleaned frequently because it sucks in all the bird bath debris and plugs up.First problem: the little suction cups on the bottom of the device are useless to hold it in place. I finally used three small rocks to keep it in the center of the water.Second: spray height and volume are highly variable depending on amount of sunlight, so it's hard to regulate on a sun/cloud day. Add wind, and the water blows everywhere out of the bird bath. Most of the nozzles shoot water too high to be useful in a bird bath when it's sunny. I need to refill water repeatedly.So....the pump works just fine except for the suction cups (not sure for how long; I've only used it for a few weeks), but it doesn't really work in a bird bath. And it will require an anchoring system of some kind to keep it from randomly floating around your body of water and spraying everywhere!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love it & bought 2 more:UPDATED 6/9/22",
    "reviewText": "Finally bought this after seeing several advertisements ~ LOVE IT! It has added a little fun to our birdbath and I found I check it reg'ly as it makes me happy. Plus, it has added some fun to our summer yard. I have now bought 2 more (1 to replace the original see info below). I have 1 unit in the bird bath and now added one to our little waterfall/pond (5' x 3' pool). They turn on with the sun and off when in shade so they do not run all the time like a solar charged battery allows. I actually like this arrangement better. The fountain starts spraying as soon as the sun shines on it. It turns off responsively too~ if light is temporarily blocked (a shadow from my hand as I fill the Bbath or a temp pass of a cloud), it turns off immediately. It is so immediately responsive, it gives the impression of an off/on switch. It does not have a switch so If we are leaving for a few days, I just put it on the shelf on our covered deck where it stays turned off until I set it in water again. The different fountain heads in deed provide for a variety of patterns of spray. It is a powerful little thing too , 1 of the heads shoots easily 12 -18\" high. If you choose not to use a patterned spray head, water will just gurgle & bubble out of the top which the birds like as well. I learned to put a ring of rocks in the bird bath to keep it centered & prevent it from moving itself too close to the edge & spilling water over the side. Colo had a string of 90+ degree days in Aug this year, so I would fill the bath everyday. If water gets too low the fountain cannot spray. Also, the motor will continue to run if the sun shines on the device but there's no water. This happened 1 or 2 and I could hear it running as soon as I walked out on the deck; it was +30'away which demonstrated the motor has plenty of power. However, It's completely quiet while in water. After 3 months of use it just quit working BUT I feel there was 1 too many times I let it run completely dry. I ordered 2 more to replace the original and added the second unit to our lil pond /waterfall area. It works great in the pond and scoots itself all over the surface. Another tip to users : I used fishing line to tie a rock to the unit thereby tethering it so it would stay out of the shaded areas and prevent it from getting stuck up against the edges. It is working great and I do not have to worry about it running out of water! As for longevity we will see; I intend to use 1 unit in the heated bird bath this winter. We'll see how cold weather affects it but also keeping in mind Denver temps can be on the mild - moderate side with a mix of cold to comfortable. Generally it is not like the looong freezing winters of the Northern states. If the 2 units do not hold up thru the next few Fall months, I will edit my 3 star longevity rating. it is a fun little feature and I recommend it to others ~ in fact I may put it under the tree this Xmas!********update: the 2 new units i bought since writing this review have held up very well!! I still luv these little fountainheads. I decided to NOT use them Nov-Feb. but outside of that time period they are in water & working almost everyday. To store them I simply take them out of water & keep covered thru winter months. I even left them outside on a shelf where they live thru extreme temp changes. I keep the 5 star rating & would go higher if i could for these reasons: longevity excellent,affordability vs value is outstanding, ease of use & maintenance could not be easer or more convenient.I would add a durability rating & give it the highest rating too. This is in consideration of my experience that they are out in all weather i.e. wide temp swings of Co. Springtime -32 -80+ that cause feet of snow, Summer’s extreme heat over100+ , hailstorms & even Fall nites that cool quickly. It’s a wonderful , fun affordable & durable addition to the yard or any body of water u want to make a lil more special but a low work impact! I’ll try to add picts next",

    "reviewText": "You get what you pay for. That said, the birds are enjoying it!Water pressure: You only get full pressure when all solar panels are fully exposed to strong sunlight. Having a branch or a bird sitting on the fountain will severely change the pressure.Spray stability: If you have full pressure, you get a nice solid consistent stream of water. But anything on the solar panels or any small cloud will turn the stream into a squirter. I'm guessing there is an electric condenser inside that collects the solar power and releases it to the motor once filled up, so you get a quick squirt and a second or two of pause.Jets: If you have full pressure, the jets spray the water over a foot high. If you have the slightest bit of wind, it may blow the water right out of your bird bath. So I am leaving the jets off completely and get a few inches of water squirting up which is plenty to keep the water rotating and cleaner.Birds: With all the low-price elements going on, the birds definitely enjoy using the bird bath! Even when low light turns the fountain into a squirter, the birds got used to it very quickly (a couple of days) and are not the least bothered by it anymore. I frequently get 6 or more birds on my bird bath (with one or two more waiting in line) from multiple species. I've had it for a few weeks, and I did not regret it - I already bought a second as backup.I might come up with something to hold the fountain in place in the middle of the bird bath so it doesn't float all over the place and push out the \"easy access branches\" I laid in the bath.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love this little fountain. It was easy to setup. I just attached the nozzles and sat it in water and it worked. It does only work during the daytime, but it does not require full sunlight; though, less sun equals less power so it trickles down to a tiny spurt. But it’s a consistent spurt every few seconds even in the shade. The area I placed it in gets several hours of direct, unobstructed sunlight though. It will slow down whenever it’s in shadow, including when you step in front of it. It runs until late in the day, but does stop when there is absolute no sunlight, so around 630-7 in mid September in my area.I purchased this so that I could have an outdoor water bowl for my dogs because they kept drinking out of my plant saucers, which I don’t want them to do, since sometimes there is neem oil in that water and I’m not sure if that may cause digestive issues.My dogs quickly learned to use this fountain instead and, despite being generally skittish, they will drink from it even in full sun when the fountain squirts its highest.This does occasionally squirt out nearly half the water in the early hours when it’s in full sun for much of the morning and afternoon. But sometimes it stays pretty contained. I’m not sure if there’s a way to control this. I have the same problems with a much more expensive fountain in my bird bath, so I think this is typical and to be expected.It also does move around the container a lot, so I covered it with a small metal cage (bottom of an old plant hanger) to keep it away from the edge of the container.It is a great little addition to my yard/garden, and I think the birds might use it too whenever my dogs are indoors. I’m grateful not to have to worry about mosquitoes breeding in the water. And I actually don’t mind that it squirts so much water out, since I have to change the water regularly anyway.",

My orders page says I returned it because I ordered several items that day and it was confused with a different item. But I still have it, it is still working great. The only maintenance I have had to do was remove the sponge filter from the bottom a couple of times and rinse out the algae. They even work on cloudy lower light days. I prefer this over the air pump because much quiter and longer lasting. It has a peaceful natural water sound and not a man made pump sound like the air pump. Thank you for your useful affordable product.",

It’s delightful to watch the water dancing and sparkling in the sunlight. The adjustable nozzles allow me to change the fountain pattern according to my preference.Easy Installation: Setting up the pump was incredibly easy. I simply placed it on the water surface, let the solar panel absorb sunlight, and it started working right away. There’s no complicated installation or maintenance required.Low Maintenance: Once installed, the fountain pump requires minimal maintenance. I occasionally clean the pump and the solar panel to ensure optimal performance, but that’s about it. It’s hassle-free and saves me a lot of time.Quiet Operation: The pump operates quietly, which is perfect for enjoying the peaceful ambiance of my garden. It doesn’t disturb the tranquility, allowing me to relax and enjoy the sights and sounds of nature.Durable and Weather-resistant: The materials used are durable and weather-resistant, which is essential for outdoor use. I feel confident that the pump will withstand various weather conditions throughout the seasons.Affordable and Cost-effective: Considering the benefits it brings, including enhancing the aesthetics of my garden and providing a soothing atmosphere, the price of the fountain pump is very reasonable. It’s a great investment for any garden enthusiast.Overall, I am absolutely delighted with the Floating Solar Powered Water Fountain Pump.

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing Performance: Solar Fountain Falls Short of Expectation",
    "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this solar fountain, but unfortunately, it did not live up to its promises. Here's a breakdown of my experience:Eco-friendly Design:The idea of an eco-friendly, solar-powered fountain was very appealing, but in reality, this product only works intermittently. It claims to run automatically in 3 seconds when sunlight is sufficient, but I found it to be highly inconsistent. Even on sunny days, the fountain often failed to start, and when it did, the spray height was much lower than advertised, barely reaching 20-30cm instead of the promised 40-60cm.Sprayer for Different Water Styles:While it comes with 6 different nozzle heads, they don't make a significant difference. The water height remains unimpressive regardless of the nozzle used. Additionally, the \"exclusive fixer\" meant to keep the fountain in place is ineffective; the fountain moves around randomly in the birdbath, making it difficult to enjoy any serenity from the water's trickling sound.Advanced Technology:The water-shortage protection feature and filtration box sound great in theory but fail in practice. The fountain stops working frequently, even when fully submerged, and the filtration box gets clogged easily, requiring constant cleaning. Despite being made of PET laminated solar panel, the fountain struggled to work properly even in mild weather conditions, let alone harsh environments.Multiple Applications:The fountain is quite small, with a diameter of only 6.3 inches, and requires a minimum water depth of 1.2 inches. This limitation makes it unsuitable for larger ponds or pools. While it might be suitable for a small bird bath or a tiny pond, the frequent malfunctions and low water height make it more of a hassle than a helpful addition.Helpful Tips:Following the tips provided, such as not allowing the water to get too low and keeping the pump clean, did not solve the fountain's problems. Even with diligent maintenance, the fountain's performance remained disappointing. The fact that it does not store any energy means it stops working the moment the sun is obscured, making it unreliable.In conclusion, this solar fountain did not meet my expectations. It is unreliable, requires constant maintenance, and fails to deliver on its promises. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a consistent and enjoyable water feature for their garden or pond. Save your money and invest in a higher quality, more reliable option.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I really hope this little fountain will last because it's just lovely. It works very well in full sun, so much so that only one nozzle doesn't throw the water out of the bird bath. When there's even a bit of shade, it pulses, instead of trickling. Which is fine with me. You can see how it reacts when my shadow covers it. The previous owners of our house neglected the bird bath, so they had stopped using it. I was really hoping the sound of the trickling water would entice them to return. After a few days, I found a couple small feathers in it, so they're coming back! No idea how long this will last, but so far, I'm loving it.",

I decided to purchase a bird bath because the birds like to get into the water dish on one of the bird feeders so it is always dirty and full of seeds, etc. I saw this solar powered fountain and thought that it would be a nice touch to add to the bird bath. It is solar powered so i don't have to worry about charging it or replacing batteries in it. It is very easy to set up and use and it makes a wonderful addition to my backyard bird oasis.",

We may try something different next year to see if there is a place in our yard that isn't as windy so we can enjoy the fountain.

The splashing water loses too much and it would not last a day saw I took my drill and drilled through the holes to make them bigger, had to keep trying till I was surprised at how large I had to drill them as this thing is that powerful. There are alternative, the power diminishes significantly if you cover any of the solar cell so I could have just put some water proof tape on the cell to reduce the height of the jets but I like fine tuning the output pressure to my own baths. Anyway, I've had one for over a year but I broke the connector the other day and bought a third just after I set up the second bath. I keep a sponge close by and wipe it down every few days or sooner if needed, the pump needs wiped down also, to keep the bath free of algae, dirt and debris and you should not use anything but water to clean it. Birds are old dinosaurs and are sensitive to chemicals. A bird bath is a lot easier to keep clean, fresh water everyday and regular cleaning will keep healthy birds coming back. Very beneficial and less messy than feeding birds, which may not be a good idea anyways, but fresh water is always needed and welcome.",

    "reviewText": "This is NOT a paid review!!This little fountain is awesome!My test to see how well it worked:I attached the tip I wanted, suctioned it to a bread pan, filled with water (covering the pump but not the tip) and the minute I stepped outside to try it the water started to spray.My findings:A) If the sun hides behind a cloud or a panel is covered (I did with my finger to test) it stops but as soon as the panel is back in full exposure this bad boy kicks up again.B) It does drain your pan of water pretty quickly unless it's set up in a wide enough base to continually recycle through, a birdbath would be perfect size to prevent the pump being out of water - which will destroy it.C) Plus, it's solar so not adding to a bill or wasting resources (the water will be drunk by the cats~ this will give it flow)So worth it, going to buy another! It looks so cool, I can't wait for the little area I bought it for to be set up. My kitten is a weirdo and loves it when the water sprays up as I'm filling the water bowl, she's going to love it!Edit 3.13.20: my outside area is set up. Today I submerged the pump in about a foot of water. It's giving perfect flow to keep the water fresh for my cats. I'll eventually build a better (as in actual) fountain but for now it's pretty dang perfect!Edit: 6.4.20 One of my units stopped working. I cleaned the area it was in, making sure the pump had no chance of running when out of water. I put everything back together and nothing. I reached out to CS to see if thry had any suggestions. Before they had an opportunity to respond I decided to take a wet cloth to the solar panel (I wipe in down every couple of days from the dust build up in my area) and it immediately started up again. This was about 4 weeks ago. Still pumping strong!",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great with a few Drawbacks",
    "reviewText": "Here are my major take aways after setting up this fountain. I have not been paid or offered gift card.1. When solar panel is in the sun, the fountain is pretty strong and runs very well - the sun has to hit the panel. If any shade hits it, the motor will weaken and \"pulse\" as some reviews mentioned. So you have to find a place that will consistently get full sun throughout the day. Cannot stress this enough. It is not like solar lights where it conserves and runs on a solar battery (I think because a water pump requires much more energy))2. The cord was not long enough for me - you may want to order an extension. Because the panel needs full sun, and I don't want my bird bath directly in the sun - I will need an extension cord - in order to place the panel where I need it, and somewhat hide the cord and not having it dangle midair. This is why I docked a star. The extension cord was another $16 dollars - and the sum is probably more than what I would have liked to spend to get it set up properlyIf I had an outlet outside, I wouldn't waste my time with this - however, if, like me, an outdoor outlet isn't available - this works pretty nicely, although not perfect, and like I said, you will probably want an extension cord, and you will end up spending close to $35 total, which IMO seems a lot for this device..",

The pump must be submerged at all times of operation and operates silently. The solar panel is connected with a 9'cord so it can be moved into the sunlight. (Direct sunlight is needed to operate and the pump does turn off if a cloud passes or area of the solar panel becomes shaded, but it starts right up again when the sun shines on it!) It's perfect for my use. Very happy with this purchase🌞",

The little stabilizers it comes with, keep it from floating around in the birdbath so it stays centered. The stabilizers are adjustable so you can set it to the size of your particular birdbath. Easy to set up. Tried all the different filters and they all made really nice patterns very easy to switch them.",

Birds make the water dirty and that clogs the sprinkler cap and the filter. I clean it several times a day because so many birds jump in the birdbath. It take only a minute or two to thoroughly clean the cap and the filter, and then it sprinkles just fine. I stopped using the rods because the birsds throw them out of the bath! It is cute and makes a nice little fountain. I am upgrading from 3 stars to 4.The fountain works pretty well. If it stops, it is usually due to a couple of reasons that are easy to fix and take under a minute do. Either low water level, or filter or sprinkler cap get dirty. Birds really make the water dirty, so need to keep the fountain clean. The birds keep removing the positioning rods and even throw them out !. I have to find them, put them back in, but in no time at all the birds somehow remove them, so I stopped putting them back. Need a bettercway to attach them. Allin all, the fountain is cute and keeps pumping as long as there is sunshine and water level doesn't get too low.",

But if your receptacle is big enough to catch all the water, the fountain won't stay centered because the brackets aren't long enough. Luckily two of the nozzles don't overstay, and those look really nice.",

I will say the deeper and bigger the bowl and higher the sides, the less you'll have to refill due to wind, evaporation and birds visiting. I am out in the gardens often daily and don't mind checking on it and refilling. It doesn't seem to have a low water shutoff, so if I wasn't going to be home, I would take it out as to not have the pump run dry. Its definitely not a set it and forget it item. I was surprised after reading other reviews that mine is working well even during clouds and overcast as seen in my video. That's a bonus. This is my first day with it so hopeful that it continues to work this well going forward.",

    "reviewText": "It’s day 1 and so far, very pleased with my solar pump and hope it continues to work and last for awhile. It literally started to pump as soon as I walked into the sunshine, submerged it in water and it immediately began to run. I’m using for a DIY fountain for a special memorial garden and didn’t want to run wires in my yard, with an electric pump. It’s strong enough to hear the water trickling and will sound so relaxing when sitting by my garden. I ordered 2 because it had great reviews, was a great price, quick shipping and had another perfect spot to use for my 2nd one.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I read all the reviews before I purchased this, and in spite of the complaints about random shadows ceasing the fountain activity, I bought it anyway. The reviews are true and correct, any slight interference with the sun (passing clouds, overcast skies, my own shadow, etc.) does cause the pump to halt immediately. This solar panel does not store the suns power - not even a smidge - so if that's what you need, this is not the product for you. However, for my purposes, this is perfect. My goal was to create a hummingbird fountain and provide a daily water source for my hummers and butterflies. I don't need the pump to run at night, that would just cause faster evaporation. Even when the pump is not running, there is still a water source for my friends, as I have it set up to keep a small bowl full. When the sun shines again, the pump resumes it's purpose of recycling the water and keeps it moving. I can't really speak to longevity yet because I've only had this for about a week now and so far it has not disappointed. If it does, I'll come back and update.The pump arrived on time and was neatly packaged. All the parts were there and in perfect condition. Comes with a little instruction manual too and was very easy to assemble. I included a measuring tape with my pictures to show the panel size, it is pretty small, but it does the job as intended. I do wish the cord was longer because I would love to have mounted the panel on my roof - once the sun sets past my awning my little fountain is done for the day. The clear hose has a curve to it from being in the package which resulted in the fountain not shooting straight up, it wants to maintain the curve resulting in a lop-sided spray. To resolve this, I found a small piece of red PVC laying around and ran the clear hose up through it to keep it pointed straight up - worked perfect.I saw a review or two that said the tips don't fit the hose but after a bit of persuasive wiggling the tip went on and worked as advertised. In fact the tips worked so well that they sprayed higher than I needed for this project so I did a bit of modifying to my hose and PVC contraption until I got the spray height I wanted. Again, keep in mind that the height of the spray is directly related to the strength of the sun. Strong sun = strong spray. And I can switch the tips whenever I want. Btw, there is no ON-OFF switch on this, but not to worry, once the water at the bottom of the planter (or pond or whatever you use) gets too low, the pump automatically shuts off so that it doesn't burn itself out. I like that a lot.So, I guess it's all about what you will be using it for. I am super happy with mine and plan to create another fountain for my rock garden. I will be buying again.",

    "reviewText": "I had previously purchased this pump a year ago. I thought it wasn't working and so I ordered a new one. It turned out, that the old one actually was still working, and therefore, I returned the new one.How does it work? I was given 2 different size ceramic flower pots. I purchase a plug for the larger pot. I had an old plastic container that used to hold VHS discs. I punched a hole in the bottom of the container, then ran the clear plastic tubing that came with the pump up through the plastic disc container, which I turned upside down after setting the motor to the solar pump inside the plastic container. Next I filled the large flower pot with water. I ran the plastic tubing through a hole in the bottom of the smaller pot and put one of the fountain heads on.Pros: After placing the solar panel in the sun, I have a beautiful tabletop fountain that sits atop a wrought iron table in my small flower garden behind my house.Cons: The pump only works when the sun hits the panel.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted to assemble a tabletop fountain to enjoy on my deck. I already have bowls of water elsewhere along with a birdbath for the deer, foxes and other wildlife that passes through. This is strictly for my enjoyment.Started with an pretty Italian glass bowl I found at a local thrift store, added some inexpensive glass vase fillers and this fountain pump. The set up and assembly was quick and easy and the action started right away. I haven't decided on it's final location yet but I appreciate the long cord from pump to solar panel as no place on my deck gets full sun all day. That way I can move the panel and leave the bowl in place.I wish I could use all of the spray attachments that it came with but in full sun they are powerful enough to spray too high and empty the bowl too quickly so I use just the one pictured. I'm holding on to the tubing as well in case I decide to change things up later.All in all, I really enjoy my little fountain when I'm outdoors. I can get snow in late fall so will have to put it away before then but I'm sure I will get a few years of use from this. Great purchase for the money.",

    "reviewText": "I'm using this pump to make an easy diy bird bath in a basic 20 inch plastic terra cotta plant dish.A few things to know prior to purchase:1. It's corded: The solar panel (which you stick somewhere that gets full sun for the majority of the day) connects to the pump inside the bird bath via a 10 ft cord. Not a big deal for me since I can hide the cord in the bath with some rocks. But just be aware you will have a cord hanging out of the bird bath (or water feature) from the pump to the solar panel.2. No sun/no pump: The pump will only operate when the solar panel is receiving full direct sunlight. So if a cloud covers the sun... or a shadow/obstruction gets between the solar panel and direct sunlight, the pump will not operate until the sun comes back out/or shadow or obstruction removed. Not a big deal, since I'm using this to keep the water fresher/cooler for the birds (it does a great job for that!). But if you'd prefer it to run more consistently during daylight hours, you'll probably want to purchase a solar pump with the internal solar rechargeable battery (which is more expensive but can be found on Amazon).3. You may have to adjust the solar panel at some point during the later half of the day as the sun starts to move. Or... If you are lucky without any obstructions (house, trees, etc) you may not have to.4. Comes with 5 different spray nozzles to provide various shooting, fountain or bubbler-like effects. Or... You don't need to use any of the included attachments and just use the pump to circulate water. But keep in mind when using the attachment heads that provide the high fountain effect: it's going to shoot 12 inches of water into the air when you get full sun/full power (at least that's my experience in the FL sun). That means: You need a big enough bird bath to accommodate the over spray/splashes...otherwise you'll lose all your water in the bath a few sprinkles at a time and need to refill the bath. Also... If it's a breezy day, the breeze can disrupt the 12 inches of fountain spray and push it outside of the bath. Hence, need to to refill the bath.I had a big issue with keeping the water from sprinkling or splashing out of my large 20 inch dish when using the 12 inch high fountain spray type attachments. Drove me nuts! Since there is no way to regulate how high the fountain will spray, what to do? I used a drill with a small bit and made the holes ever so slightly bigger... And it worked! Slightly larger holes reduced pressure and provided a spray 6 inches high VS 12 inches and solved the issue of splashes/over spray.Also... Good news: A basic plastic straw can act as an extender (in this order: Pump, straight rod attachment, straw, funnel looking attachment... And if you wish, then put a fountain cap attachment on the funnel). I was messing around with rocks inside the bird bath (for birds to perch on) with the pump hidden under the pile of rocks. Using a straw allowed me to extend the reach of the pump from under the pile of loose rocks.5. The pump has a nifty auto-shutoff feature if the bath ever ran out of water to prevent the pump from burning out.6. Also a small mesh filter is installed to help keep loose debris (dirt, leaves, etc) from entering the pump and blocking it. There are 2 backup replacement mesh filters included as well.I highly recommend... As long as you don't require the pump to remain on all day without interruption due to sun going behind clouds.Works really well to be keep your bird bath fresher and cooler. It's a fun and versatile little gadget for bird baths or decorative water features. Neat gift idea too!Update April 2024: I'm one month shy of owning this for one year... And it suddenly died. Have run the pump daily in my bird bath and it never gave me a minutes trouble. Contacted seller to see if there was a fix... and they replaced the item for free! I'm very impressed with the prompt service and response from customer service.",

I was able to turn a bird bath that was too deep for birds to ever feel safe enough to use, into a functional and beautiful addition to our backyard. I added a few rocks to give birds something to hold onto while they get a sip of water or cool off in a bath. Considering buying another one for a wildlife watering dish.",

    "reviewText": "I own a small, shallow bird bath that I wanted to add a fountain feature to. But I needed a very small pump for it to work. This is the smallest I could find. It's adorable. It looks like a toy but it isn't. With direct sunlight on the small solar panel, the stream is a good 15\" tall, and when it comes to fountains, size matters. It's actually too much for my bird bath. The water goes over the edge especially in wind, making the water drop below the required level. The pump then shuts off to protect the motor (a red LED confirms this condition). I'll have to use one of the alternate fountain adapters. It's also quiet.I do wish the solar panel was larger, as such a small footprint reduces its ability to be in full sun. I also wish it came with a taller ground spike to raise it above tall grass. It seems they decided on the size of the panel and spike based on what could fit in the small box, which isn't the best way to design products.Like most solar devices, the pump will stop if it doesn't get enough sunlight. The only way to avoid that is to get an electric pump and I'm not about to run a long extension cord under the ground. Plus I doubt I'd find an electric pump this small.The only other thing on my wish list was if it had several colored LEDs mounted on the top. That would've required more power, but not very much, and wouldn't have added much to the cost.My main concern is longevity, as some reviews said the pump died prematurely for no apparent reason, but that seems to be the case with many of them, not just this one. I had one solar and one electric fountain pump many years ago and both died after a short period.Fingers crossed this little guy lasts because it does the job quite nicely and at a very reasonable cost.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased this to add to one of our bird baths. I had another model in the past and it worked great, but it did not have the side arms, so the fountain would move it to the edge and the water would spray out until it was out of water. I had high hopes that this would work equally well but keep the water spray centered, but it does not work well. I can hear the motor running when the sun is out but the water fountain is a small trickle if anything at all. If it actually worked the arms did work as I hoped, so I hopefully can find another brand that will work better and meet our needs.",

Other than that I think it works well. Just keep it clean and filled with enough water you shouldn’t have any problems. It comes with multiple nozzles to change the flow. Very easy to set up and operate. Good value for the money. My only wish was that it stayed running when the sun went in I thought it would have had a storage battery to hold a charge to keep it running. I still like it though.",

    "reviewText": "I recently added the Passionbility Solar Fountain to my outdoor space, and I have to say, I love this little guy! It's a delightful solar water fountain that has brought a new level of charm and functionality to my yard.One of the things I love most about the Passionbility Solar Fountain is its versatility. It’s not just for one specific spot—this little fountain can be used in multiple settings. I placed it in our pool, and it instantly added a refreshing and playful element to the water. The gentle spray of the fountain creates a soothing ambiance, making our poolside relaxation even more enjoyable.Another fantastic feature of the Passionbility Solar Fountain is its eco-friendliness. Since it runs entirely on solar power, there's no need for batteries or electrical outlets. It's a great way to introduce sustainable practices into your home, and it's reassuring to know that the fountain is environmentally friendly.",

    "reviewText": "Edit: I’m changing my review from 1 to 3. The little motor *does* work, but the water temperature can’t be too hot.Unfortunately for our little fountain, we live in the south and our summers are brutal. Yesterday morning it was working great, but as the day went on and the water heated up in the sun, its power dwindled. It needs full sun (no clouds whatsoever) to run consistently, but the temperatures also have to be just right.Basically, you get what you pay for with this little guy. It’s inexpensive, but with that price point comes definite quality limitations. I wouldn’t recommend this to someone who lives in an especially hot climate, but if you live in a more mild area, I think it would be just fine.———The little motor works great outside of water, but it almost completely stops as soon as it’s submerged. Water spits out sometimes, but it’s not a steady or significant stream.",

I have it in an oversized pot and have only needed to wash it once when a flock of birds dropped a bunch of birdseed in the water. The filter doubles as the quickest I've ever seen to get seeds to sprout but was easy enough to take a part and clean.",

No.3) I figured out on my own where & how it installs. It's the Hi or Lo switch.4) If the bird bath, for example, is not in a sunny spot, you can unwind the cord from underneath the solar panel and5) separate the pump from the solar panel in order to mount the panel in a sunnier spot, but now deal with a cord. The solar panel is 3' from my full spectrum growing light. I tried different levels of water, different heights of pump placement and raising the solar panel all the way up to the aforementioned light. All the pump did was just gurgle or spurt. Fountain did at one point spray as depicted in their diagrams using one of the many choices of fountain heads, but I can't get it to repeat. This feature of separating the solar panel from the pump, explains why there are suction cups under the pump (photo 4). 6) The solar panel did not respond one bit to my small growing bulb.I am waiting for a sunny day if we ever get one before my return window closes (my heart goes out to the wild forest fires in Canada) to test if this fountain can live up to it's claims. So far, not hopeful.",

    "reviewText": "I bought Aisitin solar fountain Pump 3.5W (X003QPSZXB) in late October 2023 & started to use around Mid-May 2024. Be sure to follow instructions & recommendations about frequency & how to clean. BE CAREFULL NOT TO DROP THE VERY SMALL PIECE OF PLASTIC INTENDED TO REDUCE WATER FLOW WHEN REMOVING FILTER HOLDER. Besides the outer filter needing cleaning if you see less water being pumped than usual & its floating on ample water, it is vital to access the impeller to clean it as well. In my case something small made it’s way through the filter & stopped impeller from turning. Once I washed the area it began pumping again.I took away a star because if the pump also had a battery back up it would in all likelihood pump for several more hours a day than it does because it stops when not in direct sun light. On very cloudy days or when a shadow falls on it, the steady flow of water stops & it just pulses water slightly or not at all.",

Well i am on day 3 of overcast and rainy weather and its still worked at a lower level.Some of the attachments for the water spout would work better in a pond or larger bowl as the water fell outside the bowl but 3 worked fine.I love the arms to keep it central to the bowl.Overall very good value for money and i would highly recommend.",

    "reviewTitle": "Fontana solare con tanti giochi d'acqua, per far divertire i nostri figli e far rilassare noi grandi",
    "reviewText": "📜 Descrizione:Questo articolo, attualmente venduto al costo di 29.99€, arriva in uno scatolo brandizzato.All'interno troviamo la fontana solare, 4 sacchetti dove all'interno troviamo vari ugelli in plastica trasparente ed il manuale multilingua, anche in italiano.Per chi ha un giardino, ma anche una piscina, una di queste fontane è l'ideale, perché ravviva uno stagno statico o una vaschetta per gli uccelli.Questa, in particolare, ha un pannello circolare integrato alla fontana e la pompa è posizionata al di sotto. Non appena viene posta sotto al sole, inizia a funzionare automaticamente, senza alcun pulsante on/off... ...una sorta di crepuscolare al contrario.Logicamente, l'ho provata oggi e con il sole eroga tutta la sua potenza di 1.5W (che per muovere l'acqua è più che sufficiente).Il pannello solare ha una potenza d'assorbimento da 3.5W ed entrambi hanno 6V. La portata d'acqua della pompa è di 240l/h.Logicamente parliamo di un sistema totalmente impermeabile, in quanto deve stare dentro l'acqua per mesi ed, infatti, troviamo un IPX8.Cosa interessante è che la pompa può essere utilizzata anche per muovere l'acqua in strutture esterne, per ricreare ruscelletti artigianali, ecc..La mia impressione è che funziona bene... e la cosa che più mi è piaciuta di questa pompa è che il pannello solare sta fisso lì e non si separa dalla fontana, quindi non si vedono fili penzolanti scendere dalla vaschetta degli uccelli e la seconda cosa, è la presenza degli stabilizzatori che se aperti e, successivamente, allargati, tendono a tenere la fontanella al centro della vaschetta... rendendo il gioco d'acqua ancora più carino e d'impatto.In conclusione posso scrivere che questo articolo ha soddisfatto le mie aspettative e rende i miei figli felici, nel vedere i giochi d'acqua che questa fontanella riesce a realizzare.Logicamente il costo è un elemento importante da tenere in considerazione, ma esulerà dal voto finale in quanto, come membro Vine, voglio condividere con te solamente la mia personale esperienza con quest'articolo, poi starà a te valutarlo globalmente.💡 Suggerimenti/Informazioni:- Ti consiglio di pulire regolarmente il filtro, almeno una volta a settimana, per evitare che la pompa si danneggi. Specialmente, essendo in un luogo aperto, le impurità che si depositano nell'acqua sono molte e, queste, arrivano dritte nella spugnetta nera finendo col ridurne la portata... quindi, appena vedi che la portata del getto d'acqua viene a diminuire, anche se dopo 1 giorno o meno... pulisci il filtro, perché evidentemente ha filtrato sporco dalla vaschetta in cui si trova. (Chi ha acquari conosce bene i segreti dei filtri).- Se il sole va via (per esempio di notte), il pannello solare non eroga più energia e la fontana si ferma.Quindi, per tutto ciò scritto (basandomi sull'articolo arrivato), la mia personale valutazione è 5 stelle su 5.🖊️ Ps: In caso di novità effettuerò un aggiornamento.Ti saluto con la speranza d'aver risposto alle tue domande, dubbi o semplicemente alle tue curiosità... grazie per aver letto le mie parole e spero che questa mia recensione ti sia stata utile...Alla prossima!",

    "reviewText": "This fountain arrived quickly, and works well. It does NOT work in shady conditions, even a heavy cloud will stop the action. It came with many nozzles for different spray types. Easy to set up, and it WILL float in a pool or pond. (Not just for birdbaths!) I recommend anchoring it to a support hidden underwater, the plastic straw bumpers fall off readily and aren't really long enough to prevent water loss. For the money, it's a great little fountain. If you have a big pond and want something obvious from a distance, this is NOT your fountain. But if you have a small decorative pond and don't want to bother with wiring and possible electrocution, this fountain is superb- just unbox, attach your spray nozzle and plunk it in the pond.",

We have it in our pool and like how it look. The instructions are minimal, they could be better, we still don’t know how to place the pipes, but it is working fine. We bought this because it is solar and did not want anything with a battery. The different nozzles allows us to change it up. Early morning, you’ll get a short stream of water, as the day goes it becomes taller and stronger; the sunshine dictates the water flow and height of the stream. Glad we chose the blue; It is a nice bright blue. Price is fair, we may purchase a second one.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted to add some sort of fountain to my birdbath to attract birds. This works perfectly. I use it more as a bubbler than a fountain. It has multiple options for fountain type and height. For me, if the fountain was to tall and windy, the water blew out, so it ran low quickly. The bubbler option works the best for me in the wind and doesn't scare the birds away. It easily assembled by attaching 4 tubes to the bottom, placing in the water, and removing the paper covering the solar panel. The hardest part is figuring out which fountain attachment (which is also easy to attach and change) to use. When I clean the birdbath every one to two weeks, I use my brush to clean around the water intake vents to keep it running smooth. I have not had to change the filter yet, been using it since March.",

    "reviewText": "As other reviews have pointed out, the fountain only works if the sun is out. It doesn’t have a battery to store solar energy. Luckily, I live in a place where we get a lot of sun. I was a little worried because my brother told me I could burn out the motor If the water went dry. That’s happened lots of times with no problems. In fact, I can hear the motor quietly running even when there’s no water in the birdbath. But the fountain starts immediately as soon as I put water in. The fountain comes with different nozzles so that you can adjust the type of water flow. When you set it up, you have to attach four small tubes. These not only feed water into the fountain, but they keep the fountain centered. I’ve had the fountain two months and it works beautifully as long as the sun is out and I remembered to fill up the basin. The fountain is not only pretty, but it aerates the water to help keep it clean and free of green goop. For the price, I’m definitely happy.",

    "reviewText": "This compact solar fountain is a good choice for areas of full, uninterrupted sunlight as it does not charge and continue to operate out of full sunshine to which I was disappointed with as my backyard patio is covered, but gets nice morning and evening sunlight in late spring through early fall. Thus this fountain barely performed in that location. I moved it out to the front deck which is full sun all day and it worked amazing. I spent several minutes changing out the different spray attachments to see how each worked and looked before selecting one. Changing the attachments is very easy so that is a plus. There are also four clips and plastic tubes which attach to the underside of the fountain to help it stay centered in whatever basin, birdbath, bowl or container it is placed, if you want, and the tubes can be cut to accommodate. Once I had it situated and my container filled with water, I was initially pleased with the power of the spray and the overall look. However, upon returning about 10 minutes later to check it, the fountain had STOPPED! It had used up all the water in the roughly 10inch diameter x 3inch deep basin! My conclusion was that most of the water spray had gone up and over the edges of the basin thanks to a light breeze and the attachment I had selected. Since I live in an area that is always a bit breezy, I'm going to need to reevaluate the size of the container to catch the falling water and/or a way to fully secure the fountain to the center of whatever container I use to avoid water spray over the sides.After all this, I'm not sure I will keep the product or if a submersible fountain set up will work better for what I want.",

This one has been going for a couple months with zero issues. It just works. You do need to pull the filter sponge out periodically to clean the debris off of it (grass, leaves, feathers etc), but it's so simple to do and the fountain will work perfect when reassembled. I'm so happy we finally found a fountain that works so well.",

It turns out this was the problem ...a few grains of sand had gotten in there and were preventing the impeller from spinning. So I can now recommend this product. It works well.",

    "reviewTitle": "Well Made & Effective",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Thought I’d take a risk on a solar floating fountain as I’ve a couple of small ponds mainly for water adapted plants. The box comes with the solar panelled fountain and lots of attachments etc - usefully there’s a comprehensive booklet and there’s really not a lot to do other than placing the pump in the water - you allow the air to bubble out of it as you submerge it by placing it in the water at angle. It then floats and should start to work (it works even when cloudy but only minimally for obvious reasons). I have used the tube attachments which fit into the sponge (there are pre made slots in the sponge) basically to keep the fountain more or less centred in the planter.The placement of my ponds is a little shady and the pump did throw some water up but I considered it would be nice to have it sited somewhere where it could work for most of the day. I had a planter which came with a bung so filled with water and placed in an area of the garden I know gets more or less sun all day (north facing garden being the issue)….. and the fountain is great- very effective and super to have some water play as well as the sound. I think I’ll still end up buying another two for the ponds even if they do fall in shade at times during the day.Build wise the fountain is nicely finished and appears to be well constructed - the glass should be more resistant to the effects of UV unlike plastic. The pump started to work as soon as I got it out of the box - I’d recommend to anyone who has a water small feature in the garden - very reasonably priced.Update: had this for a couple of years now and still going strong. Bought 2 more since. Not sure why negative reviews are left when all the packaging clearly states it won’t work as well if it’s cloudy or dark - it would mean having to store the energy and that would mean a battery - a heavier item would not sit well in water. For the money this is great and works as it should. If the sprays seem weak you need to check that the mesh protecting the pump from debris doesn’t need cleaning as this usually the cause. Always good to check the glass for limescale build up (if topping up the water feature with tap water) as this inhibits the solar cells - BarKeepers Friend helps clean the glass if it’s just dull and limescale remover for deposits.",

The only downside is that, like the instructions say, any bit of cloud cover makes the pump essentially pretty useless - it only works during fully sunny days. Other than that, it does what it needs to do.Side note: make sure to clean the filter in the water pump daily. The birdies like to drop food into the bird bath while eating,so the little bits of millet get stuck in the filter and can clog up the sprinkler if not cleaned daily. Easy fix, but definitely something to consider.",

I don't have one area in my yard that is full sun all day so no matter where I've moved this is doesn't work for more than a few hours at a time. Unfortunately just doesn't work for my yard. I guess I assumed that like most solar panel it would store solar energy for the shady time of day. Otherwise it works well for the size and cost.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This little fountain does what I want. It’s small but packs a punch. I control the fountain height by putting paper over half the panel then adjust as needed. Still experimenting. My bird bath is 15 inches in diameter. To stabilize the foundation I cut a circular piece of hard clear plastic and stuck the fountain to it. Easy Peasy. The rocks are then placed on the plastic. I recommend you try it but prepare ahead of time. Read the reviews.Update: Fountain going strong and it’s been over a month. No signs of mosquitoes since they don’t like moving water. Algae doesn’t form as quickly. The birds are getting used to the water fountain sound. It’s almost 100 degrees so I put ice in the bird bath. Wow! The birds are enjoying the cool water. I would buy again. I recommend!",

    "reviewText": "I was very excited to get this pump as the reviews were good but most wrote the review soon after recieving it. I wanted to give the pump a little time before reviewing it. The little pump was powerful and the solar battery worked as it was written. When full sun hit the cell, the pump worked full cycle, but when a cloud or anything covered even part of the cell, the pump either stopped or slowed which was fine because that is how this particular one works, no power is stored for cloudy days, but that is OK. . BUT, after the second week of having it, the pump quit working all together. Now, I can't tell if it is the pump or solar part. I think it is the solar cell, because I feel no vibration of the pump at all, which I take as no power being sent to the pump. Maybe it was just bad luck and this particular little solar pump was just a lemon. I have not written to the seller yet as I don't think I have any recourse and am passed the time of return. I will update review if I speak with the seller.Follow up:The 5 star is for the seller. After reading my review they sent me out a replacement before I contacted the. Fantastic seller and a great little solar pump.",

    "reviewText": "pump is really great, Made a concrete pool for it and works like a charm. What it needs are more different nozzle styles. I modified one by closing the small holes around the outside and enlarging the one in the middle. This causes a small spray and less loss of water, a good compromise between using as blubber and having a lot of small sprays. Could also include a six foot plastic tube (3/8\" inside dia) to give you more options and a way to easily drain your water container.For those wondering looks like the flow stops during an eclipse",

    "reviewText": "UPDATED - 11/23/18 - Well, that was short lived. It was working fine for a few days. Then it just quit. I took my fountain apart to look at the pump, nothing clogging it. I played around with it but could not get it to work. It just plain quit. Not worth it. I will save my money and purchase real solar fountain pumps.I bought this with little expectations, it was about $25 so I thought if it works great, if not I can have fun with the solar panel. (NOTE!!! I do not use the attachments for spraying, I just use the pump and solar panel to power a bird bath fountain I already have.)I bought it to power a small bird bath fountain which had a plug in pump that I never hooked up. It has sat around for about 5 years just holding water but I never used the pump that was in it.Went about cleaning it up and installing this little pump. Works very well for now. It does exactly what it says, it runs in direct sunlight and pushes the water up the approximately 18 - 24 inches of fountain. It does not have a lot of pressure but it pushes the water enough to circulate and make the fountain work. I finally have a running water bird bath.I just set it up today (11/16/18). If/when it fails I will try and remember to come update the review. I am going to experiment with placement of the solar panel to get the most run time. I also ordered another one so when this one fails (as it will, eventually) I will have another ready to use.Pros - worked out of the box, was able to adapt to my bird bath fountain, easy to use.Cons - did not have the little foam filter listed, that is it but I cannot give 4.5 stars.Overall very happy with it so far.",

    "reviewText": "This fountain works very well. In fact, so well, that if there is a light breeze, it can pump out the birdbath. I drilled out the shower head attachment holes to 1.25mm to make the spray coarser and not too high. With the separate solar panel, one can orient it for best operation. On overcast days, the fountain pulses, but will not operate continuously. (It's solar remember).This was my second solar fountain. The floating style, while appealing, did not work in the low-angle winter New England sunlight. This one does.At first, it did not work, but required a light tap to knock loose some particles loose from manufacturing. Otherwise, it has worked flawlessly.There is a filter under the intake grille, so be sure to clean it occasionally.",

This is not a pump that runs on a solar battery so you have to expect that it will not run when there are clouds. I have it hanging on a hanging basket shepherds hook by a wire I installed through the two holes that were already on the frame of the solar panel. I did this so that I can change the direction of the panel to move with the sun. In the pictures you can see the position of the panel; the sun was not shining directly on the panel but the pump continually worked. It is not like this on cloudy days but is what I expected. I find that I prefer this over the ceramic battery operated water mover I purchased in 2016 which lasted one season before getting all corroded.",

    "reviewText": "It was a dark and stormy night.Well, not really, but it was pretty overcast when this little fountain got delivered. Knowing how dependent these things are on direct sunlight, I figured I wouldn't be able to test it out until the next day when we had some sunlight. But I packed it out to put in my little birdbath anyway, and as soon as I took it outside I could hear the motor starting to whir. I hadn't even got out from under the shade of my deck, and it was already working.It's a nice little fountain, and the dealer has even been so kind as to include a suction cup and some fishline to moor it in place. Since I have a porcelain birdbath, that keeps it in the middle of the basin, so the water's less likely to blow out, providing you don't use the fancy spray nozzles. I just want to see the water moving, so I'm good with leaving off the attachments.",

The solar panel has a fairly long cord so you can place it in a spot away from the bird bath. I wish the solar panel part had a strap to attach it so it stays in place but you could probably use a piece of string to do that job. It comes with several fountain heads but if you use it in a bird bath you would be best to just use the short pipe that extends the height so the water is kind of like a bunker that makes a nice burbling sound the birds like and the water doesn’t splash out of the birdbath.",

    "reviewText": "These do a great job on my DIY fountain leading into a small bird bath in my back yard. So far it's been in use for over a month and it's worked consistently. It has the power needed to carry the water up 3 feet to the top of the fountain. The kit came with plenty of fittings and tubing to do what I needed it to do. Another great feature is the auto shut off. My fountain isnt very deep, and during the 100 degree heat, i wasnt thinking about refilling it.Well water evaporated and the pump stopped running. I was qorried at first, but then realized it only turns on of water is contacting the pump which is awesome. The #1 reason for pump failure is running them dry, and with this you wont have to worry about it I have no complaints, and I'll be buying another set if I have another fountain project in the future.",

Clouds or tree shade rendered the system to no working as there was not enough energy to convert to drive the pump. I ended up changing over to a USB pump (wired) so the fountain could facilitate operating in all conditions and keep the water move for the hummingbirds and to stave algae growth. I think the product works, but our use case asked more of the product than it was capable.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. UPDATE: After more than a year, pump is still working great. As long as you clean gunk out of the pump every so often, it will last a while. Honestly, I've only cleaned it three times so far.As soon as I put this out in the sun it started working. I am using it as a hummingbird fountain and it's perfect for that. I rigged up the fountain according to a youtube video I saw. Very easy assembly, the tubing that comes with it fits perfectly to the base of the pump. If you wanted to purchase additional tubing, the opening is right at 5/16\". As you can see and hear in the video, it has a very strong flow coming up through the nozzle, I have the pump sitting at the bottom of an old planter and the water is pumping up through about 8\" of tubing and is doing a pretty good job pushing water up and out at that distance. For a small pump, it is surprisingly powerful. I've had it for 2 months and I haven't had to clean the filter yet, but not much can get through the small holes I've made in the top cover, it keeps leaves and other debris from clogging filter.Two months later, it's still working very well. I also observed the fountain working in complete cloud coverage on a few occasions. It wasn't coming out as high as it was in the video, but it was a steady flow, to be honest, it is not the norm, most overcast days it does not work. The still photo was taken in the rain and you can see how well it was pumping out. The video was taken on a sunny day, but in a partly shaded area. It doesn't work at all at night, but it's not expected to, it has no battery back up. I would definitely purchase another one.",

The water with provided tubing can handle 3 feet projection on a cloudy day. Great value. Can’t beat the price of 2 for 1. UPDATE: Have my water feature installed with tubing and fountain head sprayer. Sprayer does not fit tightly on tubing. I recommend cutting the tubing at an angle in order to get a snugger fit. Not a deal breaker but wish the sprayer attachment was the same size as fountain pump.",

When there is full sun on the panel, it works well. Otherwise, it barely runs. There is no 'battery' that gets charged in case you do have a cloud or two so it all but stops running. The very irritating part though was the tubing provided does not fit the nozzle pieces. I wanted a solar pump to make a small bird bath/water decoration. I am having to constantly move the panel so it gets 100% sun, I had to get an adapter to use the nozzles, and not all of them work with the adapter, so I'm limited there as well. I figure I'll keep this for now, but certainly would not recommend it to anyone else and will likely have to find a better option at some point.",

    "reviewText": "The pump worked well, so good that I purchased another since another 5 yr old pump stopped working.The pump worked for since mid March 19, 2024 and stopped August. I guess too good to be true since my last 2 pumps lasted 5 years. It seems the solar panel gave out and no longer supplied electricity to the pump. Now lets see how pump #2 does, it only has about 2 months in.They seem like a very nice pump set up and I know they only have 30 day warranty but it seems when the solar panel gets hit with a big rain water must infiltrate the panel and it stops working.Do not buy this product. This was my 3rd one, something changed in manufacturing and they are not as good as the first one purchased over 5 years ago.",

    "reviewText": "first off: even though I read the dimensions several times, I was still shocked at how small the solar panel was/is. . . having said this, it works soooooo well I literally just purchased a second one!! also, the cord is super long so there's plenty of flexibility to catch the sun & if yr around you can angle it to throughout the day as the sun moves for maximum effect.things to remember: this is solar powered ONLY, not electric, & there is no battery cell to store up energy so it will not work after the sun goes down (although it does seem to work - albeit more minimally - when it's overcast!).if you intend to use the larger fountain spraying attachments, you may need to use a wider bird bath/basin, something like a 20\"+, to prevent water loss. for smaller basins the smaller nozzle attachment is probably best - it will provide movement, sound, & aeration without over spraying & water loss.also remember to periodically clean the pump! there's a sponge filter in there to catch debris - this needs to be rinsed out from time to time, & also an impeller to pull out & rinse off as well. performing these simple maintenance steps should keep these working great for some time to come.",

    "reviewText": "SO happy with this little solar fountain! Went through three other solar fountains before finding success with this one. This is perfect if you want a solar fountain but prefer to keep your bird bath in the shade. The long cord allows you lots of leeway to find the perfect sunny spot to hang the small but mighty solar panel. Package includes various fountainheads which gives you many choices for different sprays. We prefer the \"gurgling\" head which minimizes evaporation.Easy to take apart and clean. We do this every week or so. Expected because the neighborhood birds LOVE taking baths in our clean, immaculate birdbath but boy, they sure do leave behind a lot of dirt when they bathe! It's very easy to slide out the little propeller, as well as sanitize the filter in a little bit of hydrogen peroxide. (Previous solar fountains we bought did not have a way to clean the motor, so things got pretty gross pretty quickly. Get this if you're a clean person and love providing fresh crystal clear water for our winged friends).Other likes: The suction cups hold the little fountain firmly in place. The volume of water flow is impressive considering it's size.Note: Water flow is best in the most direct sun. Even a slight tilt to catch the rays can make all the difference. This will not work under shade or with ambient light.",

    "reviewText": "I was hoping this would work well in a shallow birdbath. While it functions best when the birdbath is full, the spouts eject the water so high that it shoots out of the bath, causing it to empty quickly and stop working within a couple of hours, requiring frequent refills.Additionally, the solar panel only works in direct sunlight and is ineffective on cloudy days. The wire to the solar panel is also very stiff, necessitating the use of the provided stakes to secure it.Overall, this item works, but it doesn't perform as well as other all-in-one solar birdbath fountains I've used.",

    "reviewText": "My mom requested a fountain for her birdbath for her birthday. She loves birds and has multiple feeders up and a birdbath, and thought a fountain would be neat. It’s worked really well! Just today she watched a small flock of 5 houses finches flitting around and taking turns landing on the birdbath and getting drinks, and one even took the opportunity to take a bath. Having a fountain has really attracted more birds.It was easy to set up, and there are several nozzles so you can pick what kind of fountain you want. It really does work best in full sun, it doesn’t really do anything in full shade. The stream can go really high when in the sun, to the point that water can splash outside the fountain if the birdbath is on the smaller side. My mom puts about a gallon of water a day in it to keep it going. This seems to be all the maintenance it requires. Highly recommend if you love watching birds!",

    "reviewText": "I like this solar fountain, I use it in a bird bath to add some ambiance sound in our backyard and it attracts the birds and even bees drink from it. This one floats around though and often goes to one side because of the wind (even with the clear stick things). They make them now with build it \"wings\" or \"legs\" so it stays in the center. This also helps the bees so they don't drown. There are several different attachments to create different effects.It sometimes doesn't work when the full sun is on it. It goes on and off like it's confused and it annoys me. I wish it worked consistently with the full sun.",

So well in fact, I had to take the little disk off the top of the spray attachment because the water was spraying outside of the dish! I keep a 16\" round shallow dish on the ground for frogs, chipmunks, and other ground critters. I placed the fountain in the middle, and there is still room around it for birds or frogs to hop in for a soak.The panels don't really hold a charge though, so you won't get much water movement on a cloudy day.",

With none of the included tops on it, it acts more like a bubbler which is how I've been running it.I have had it running for a month and a half, outside in a bird bath. The birds do not like it They refused to go near it for weeks. Now a few will take a drink but none will bathe.. .The bird bath without this fountain gets all the bathing and almost all of the drinking action..The solar panel top looks to be delaminating. It started doing that after less than 1 month.So without a filter sponge it gets clogged with algae, the deteriorating solar cells are making it not work well even when cleaned and the birds hate it.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice fountain action with just solar power!",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a very nice fountain for a small water feature or pond for keeping water fresh and aeriated for bird baths and other wildlife like butterflies, dragonflies, etc. ... with no electrical cord or outlet needed!Please keep in mind that it needs good sunlight to work to it's fullest pumping capabilities. It will continue to work to a diminished degree if it becomes shaded during the course of the day, but don't expect it to spray as high as it is capable of doing under direct sun when it is very cloudy or in shaded conditions. That said, this new model works much better in the shade than my older model. You also should be careful that it's not emptying your water reservoir if it isn't centered so as to not spray water outside the bowl or pond ... especially if the wind picks up and blows the spray in directions you didn't anticipate. On this new fountain I'm using the included plastic \"bumpers\", on my old one I use rocks to keep it from drifting in the bowl. You will also have to play with the eight or so fountain heads to see which you like the best, as well as which heads don't spray water out of your reservoir and empty your water! Also, remember to check your water level in your reservoir on a regular basis, keep it free of leaves, etc., and occasionally clean the little fiber filter which only takes a moment to clean. Other that that this is a very dependable little \"work horse\" for a very reasonable price!I have an older day & night version of this fountain with LED lights and separate power bank and a sensor that lights up and sprays after dark that is still working very well after more than a year and a half, (see the ground level red/blue/green/yellow bird bath in the background). This particular new version is only a daytime version w/o the LED lights, (the copper/green raised bird bath in the foreground), but I like it quite well and it does work better in the shade than the older model. I see that they also still offer the day/night LED lighted version, so it's just a matter of preference and a bit difference in price.I included a short 8 second video of what to expect if your fountain becomes shaded during the day from clouds or from shading from a fence or tree blocking the sun at different times of day/season. That doesn't mean it's broken, just not getting full sun ... assuming the filter is not blocked, of course.I think you'll really enjoy this little fountain. I know my cardinals, blue jays, wrens and dragonflies do, as I can watch them throughout the day while they are drawn to and visiting my bird baths! ; -)",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It was super simple to set up and worked immediately. The only thing that I don't like is that it has to have full sun to operate. As you can see in my video, my shadow even causes it to not work at full strength. So I wished they could come up with something that would allow it to work in the shade. Because I don't want to put my birdbath directly in the brightest and hottest part of my yard. I wanted to put it in a flower garden that I have made for birds and butterflies which I purposely created to get only morning sun and not the hot afternoon sun. A place the birds can cool off in the shade and have a water source. But I cant put it there because the fountain doesn't work at all in that particular flowerbed. So it kind of defeated the whole purpose of getting it. In order for it to work, I had to move it to another flowerbed that is in the direct afternoon hot sun. The birdbath is small and shallow so when the fountain is working at full strength, the water sprays out of the birdbath which quickly empties it of water. So it will only work about 45 minutes max before the water is completely emptied out. This of course isn't an issue with the fountain but with my birdbath. Otherwise this is really a cute fountain and I like that it comes with different spouts so you can change out the waterfall style. It also floats around a lot and doesn't stay in the middle of the birdbath. Although it comes with these plastic straws to use as \"arms\" to keep it from moving, they don't help at all. I ended up having to put a rock on each one of the arms to keep it from moving. But by doing this means that my birdbath holds even LESS water than it normally does because of the rocks taking up space.",

    "reviewText": "I was hesitant to buy this but SO Glad I did! I am using this in a hanging birdbath that is 12\" round x 3\" deep at the center. The assembly took less than 5 minutes. There are 7 different hard plastic spray nozzel attachments to create different looks to the fountain. I opted for the multi spray nozzel. At first it only shot the water up about 1 inch because it was still morning. Once the bright 11am sun hit the solar panels surrounding the fountain, the water shot up about 15 inches and ran steadily!!!! It was Amazing and Fun to watch!!! The only thing to be aware of, is that if it is windy, the sprays of water may go outside of your container, thus diminishing the water levels and could damage or burn up the pump. Just be sure you always have plenty of water at all times in your birdbath. I would Definitely suggest getting one of these. It adds fun to your birdbath and you can change the spray patterns Very easily!!!I took one star off, because it only has solar panels, and does NOT have a solar battery to keep the output of the fountain running constantly. Like they stated in their ad, if it is cloudy the pump will not function as well, if at all.A Great improvement would be to add a solar battery with a light sensor or timer, so it would operate during the day and would shut off at night. I know they do this with patio lights and garden lights so I'm sure it could be done.....",

Although the fountain comes with several attachments that direct the water into a spray, I found that the straight forward gush of the unadorned fountain worked best for attracting birds. In addition, the lower height of a fountain's spray helps the water to stay in smaller vessels, so you don't have to refill them every couple of days. This fountain is simple and reliable. It emits only the gentle sound of a small water bubbler, which is enough to attract and not scare birds. A fun addition to any garden.",

    "reviewText": "This pump definitely has its pros & cons. The pros are that it's inexpensive, and really pumps the water through it creating at times at least a 16-18\" high stream of water. The cons are that if there is no sun, it doesn't work. It doesn't retain power that it can use later. If it's cloudy sometimes I will get intermittent bursts of water which isn't a bad thing, or none at all which is. One other con is that when it's really sunny out that fountain is powerful. So much so that it spews the water right out of the birdbath & onto the ground. What this means for me is that if I want my fountain going all day I have to refill it 2-4 times a day depending on just how sunny it is. If you don't mind refilling a few times a day on a sunny day, this is an inexpensive fountain that actually works.",

    "reviewText": "Update: 07/23/23The pump was great while it worked. However, 10 weeks after receiving it, it failed and would no longer work. I don't know if the solar panel failed or the pump itself died. I haven't taken it apart to diagnose the problem. It was never run on an empty birdbath and I would clean it on a weekly basis. I would flip it over when it was out of the water so it wasn't facing the sun to prevent the motor from running without any water. One evening it stopped when the sun went down and the next morning it wouldn't start up. I've now bought a different pump that has the panel separate from the pump so that the panel isn't submerged. Let's see how long that lasts.This pump includes stabilizing straws that keep it centered in the birdbath that I bought with it. Also, one of the included nozzles sprays water horizontally which keeps the water in the birdbath. The ones that spray the water vertically end up splashing the water outside the bath and the water gets drained in 2 ~ 3 hours. With the horizontal nozzle, the water stays for up to 3 days.The pump does stop working when it's no longer in direct sunlight even if it's bright daylight and the sun is shining in other portions of the backyard. It works for 6 ~ 7 hours continuously depending on how you place it.",

    "reviewTitle": "Fun little solar fountain",
    "reviewText": "It needs full and bright sun. I live in BC, Canada, and if the sun isn't mid-summer hot, then the fountain doesn't perform well. I am sure that if you lived anywhere that had full sun (everywhere south of the 49th parallel?) , this fountain would be great. It was great, but the weather this summer could have been better. No fault of the solar fountain.In full sun it has a nice high fountain. When it has part sun it spurts and the birds don't like the erratic water pressure. I have 2 parrots and I was able to put them outside with this on sunny days and they loved the shower. If it is not anchored to the center of the water fountain, it can drain your water, because it has a 12\"+ high fountain, that (depending on the wind and the shower head used) can spray water off the edge of the bird bath or dish that you use. The dish has to be large enough to catch the excess spray so you don't lose too much water.It is a great little solar fountain that needs a little set up from you, but otherwise creates a small area of cool air for the birds to bathe in, in the summer heat. The robin juveniles liked it the most.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased this in tandem with a bird bath and recieved them the same day. It is decievingly easy to install. As soon as the sun hit it, it came to life in my hand. Unfortunatly the water inlet was located on the palm of my hand where the skin is thinnest. Soon the suction of the fountain had adhered itself to my hand with such force that I was unable to pull it off. In a matter of seconds, it started pumping a pretty, red fountian of blood out of my hand that was doing a Jackson Pollock painting all over the deck. My wife passed out so she was little to no help and I found myself alone fighting this parasitic puck that was slowly taking my life. In the throes of battle I turned, and for a second caught the rising sun through the crimson drops and thought \"how beautiful\" just before opening my eyes and realizing it was all just a dream.If you've made it this far, just know that the good reviews have already said it all. It works well. has plenty of fountain patterns, and is easy to assemble. I can't speak to longevity as we've only had it a few weeks but we are very satisfied with it and will repeat this purchase if it \"breaks\" for whatever reason.",

You do need to keep the bird bath filled with water at all times and watch for dehydration of the water. Also, make sure to use the best nozzle so the water doesn't splash too high and spill over. Also, you may need to clean out the suction vents if your bird bath has things in it that can get sucked in. Only works when sun is on the device. Doesn't work in the dark fyi.",

    "reviewText": "It works decently enough. In shade it spurts rather than runs steady. But in full sun it can really pump the water out! It has multiple attachments which modify the fountain stream. The ones that go highest are the most attractive but also are the ones that allow water to be blown out of the birdbath and onto the ground. So most of the time I use the more modest aerator tips. All in all, it is worth the inexpensive price, but know that the fountain is inexpensively made and may not last a long time. Jury is still out on this.",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the solar fountain bird bath, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This delightful addition to my garden has exceeded all my expectations. Not only does it attract a variety of beautiful birds, but it also adds a soothing and tranquil ambiance to the entire outdoor space. First and foremost, the solar-powered feature is simply outstanding. The fountain operates solely on the power of the sun, eliminating the need for any electrical connections or batteries. The fountain itself creates a gentle and mesmerizing water flow, which provides a refreshing and inviting space for birds to bathe and drink. One aspect that pleasantly surprised me was how well the solar fountain bird bath handles different weather conditions. While it functions optimally under direct sunlight, even on slightly cloudy days, it continues to operate efficiently. However, it is worth noting that excessive cloud coverage or prolonged periods of overcast weather can impact the battery abilities of the fountain. During such times, the fountain may not operate at full capacity or may temporarily pause until it receives sufficient sunlight to recharge the battery. Nevertheless, this occasional setback doesn't overshadow the overall performance and functionality of the bird bath.",

Slightest bit of shade will decrease or stop the spray. The one flaw is the amount of spray that makes it so pretty to look at and listen to is also its only negative. Needs to be in a large container or pond as it will rapidly empty with the slightest breeze. Take this comment seriously that everyone is cautioning in reviews. It is definitely a fact. I have mine on our south facing deck and most days there is a slight breeze. I fill it 2-3 times a day and it is a deep container. If you don't mind the inconvenience, for the price, it really is a terrific unit that adds a lovely ambiance to your patio or deck.",

    "reviewText": "This solar fountain was a nice add on for my garden. It attracts different kind of birds to take a shower, bees, even I saw a couple lizards coming to drink some water.Unfortunately, after less than two months it stopped to work. It's not because a clogged filter. Everything looks fine, something went wrong with the inside electronics.------- UPDATE 11/11/2024I was contacted by someone from the supplier, who had read my original review. He asked me to perform a cleaning procedure for the rotor of the pump, but the problem was not solved.After that the supplier sent me a replacement unit at no cost to a friend's address in Florida. I will have to wait until somebody could travel to Ecuador and bring this item with him.I will change my overall rating to 4 stars because of the excellent support given by the supplier. I hope I will receive this item soon, so I would update my review again.",

Die Lieferung erfolgte rechtzeitig und das Gerät war gut verpackt, was für einen sicheren Transport spricht.Der Springbrunnen funktioniert einwandfrei. Die Solar-Panels sind effizient und sorgen dafür, dass der Brunnen tagsüber regelmäßig in Betrieb ist.Ein Punkt, den ich noch nicht beurteilen kann, ist, wie sich das Gerät im Winter verhalten wird. Ich werde es im Auge behalten und hoffe, dass es auch in der kälteren Jahreszeit gut funktioniert.Insgesamt kann ich den AISITIN Solar Springbrunnen bis jetzt sehr empfehlen. Er bringt Leben in meinen Teich und sorgt für eine angenehme Atmosphäre.",

Needs the full Sun to power it effectively but will work to varying degrees with lesser light. There is no battery to store the power.Easy to assembly, takes seconds and a nice variety of nozzles for different flow sprays.Note that the pump will continue to work even if there is not enough water around so could burn itself out, no automatic shut off.",

I have birds and humming birds using the birdbath and this fountain pump just made the bird bath even better. It was easy to set up and the color panel works great. I had to add this small birdbath because I had a humming bird nest in the area and the babies keep coming back and some other baby birds that hatched from a nest in my back year haven now gone to the font porch maybe because it gets shade all day long.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Zero assembly required except securing the screw attachment for the power wire. The battery was already charged partially so the moment it hit the sunlight and the pump went underwater it began pumping. It seems high quality for it's class, the lowest priced class. I did not want to spend a lot on this item. It functioned flawlessly all day so far. As sunset came, it was also overcast and raining. There was enough sunlight to keep it pumping!!! Most fountain pumps would have stopped at this point. The extra features of a battery to keep pumping for a while after dark, compared to direct current to the pump is great. The feature to prevent overheating of the pump by low water levels is also great, most in this class lack that feature. It has a long power cord so the solar panel can go in a better light area than the container pond which is partially shaded intentionally. I honestly think that his is the highest quality system in the $14 to $17 USD price class. Pick this one. (in the video attached, I did not add the fountain attachment and instead only need the water to move across the surface, you actually get better aeration and cooling that way, but you can still see the water move. the betta fish seems to like it.)",

    "reviewText": "Birds love this fountain in their birdbath. I previously had the round floating version with the solar panel right on the fountain. It worked great but when birds hopped onto it to splash in the bubbling water, their body would block the sunlight and the water stopped bubbling up. This fountain has a remotely placed solar panel so the birds can splash in the bubbling water as much as they want. They love it! The battery backup keeps it bubbling for hours after the panel is out of the sunlight. Very happy with it!",

    "reviewText": "It does what it’s supposed to do for now. The solar panel and battery are effective but try to mount the panel somewhere it’ll get steady sun all day. For me the cord was long enough that I could put the birdbath in a semi tucked away location that birds like while locating the panel on top of a fence post. I can see that dirt will compromise function if I’m not vigilant about keeping gunk out of the bird bath on a daily basis. That’s kind of annoying. For that reason I’ll probably just get a water jiggler when this thing inevitably breaks. A bonus… you’re not limited to the nozzle assemblies in the pictures. I played with it and have more of a bubbling action going. My bird bath is on the small side, so the tall spray patterns were pumping the water outside the basin and it turned itself off pretty quickly.",

In other words, it only works when the sun is hitting it. Maybe they can add a battery to hold some charge to it. It's otherwise really easily to install and very pretty. Great product!",

I’ve only used it for one day, but the fountain operated reliably, even on a relatively cloudy day, which pleasantly surprised me.The pump itself seems quite powerful, and the water flow can be adjusted using a variety of supplied nozzles. There is no filter to clean, making it easy to maintain without the hassle of unscrewing the pump. Only time will tell if the lack of a filter causes any issues with functionality in the future. Overall, it’s a solid choice for anyone looking for a solar fountain with a battery backup, allowing it to continue running in the dark",

    "reviewText": "The GAIZERL Solar Fountain Bird Bath Fountains Pump was purchased to provide a fountain for an improvised bird bath. Though some reviews claim it does not work in the shade, I found that it works in spurts in an overcast sky. When it builds up enough energy, it will pump water for a few seconds. This occurs about every 5 or 10 seconds. So for my purposes that is good news. I don't want the bird bath water becoming stagnant and encouraging an infestation of mosquitos.In full sun, the pump works well for its size and power. With the 8-nozzle head, the spray is approximately 18 inches high. I am using the side spray nozzle as the wind was blowing the tall spray all over. With the side nozzle in full sun light, the pattern is approximately 12 to 14 inches in diameter.This review asked for a rating on longevity. I have only had the pump a few weeks. So far, I am pleased with its performance. At this price, it can easily be replaced without too much hassle.The arms that keep the pump away from the sides of the bird bath are approximately 4 to 5 inches long. They do a good job keeping the pump away from the edge of the bird bath. There are no instructions of how the arms are to be fastened to the pump. Sliding the fitting in the locations on the bottom of the pump were there is a rubber section seems to work.I wanted the pump to stay centered in the center of the bird bath. I used a clear plastic container that food chains use for prepared fresh fruit. It's diameter is about an inch larger than that of the pump. My bird bath is 4 inches deep. So i cut the plastic container down to about 3 inches high to keep it below the surface of the water. I drilled holes around the lower portion to allow the water to flow into the pump. Small pebbles hold the container from moving around. I will change that to using industrial double stick tape to hold the container in place. Then I will not need the small rock to weight the container down. The pump floats nicely in the center of the container. As a result, the arms are not needed.",

    "reviewText": "I love this fountain! The photo that I included was taken on a cloudy day when it was lightly sprinkling rain. The water, in straight-up sun, usually sprays up about 12 inches. Tbh, I got this a few weeks ago. I opened it, and there were several tiny plastic bags with parts, and I didn't feel like dealing with it. I wish I had put it out sooner! Today I dumped out the package. The little parts included are not complicated. There is 1 piece you stick on to be like the fountain part. Then you choose one cap to be your sprayer thing. There are several choices. I just picked one and haven't tried the others yet. Then you stick the 4 things that look like straws on the edge around the bottom. These are just to keep it from drifting to the edge of your container. I filled an old planter with water just to try it out. It works perfectly in full sun! I love it! I'm planning on doing something more creative with it. Maybe I will create a rock garden around it and have this in the center. I love the soothing sounds of water trickling. This fits the bill for me! There's no way I could afford one of those expensive, outdoor fountains. At this price, I plan to buy several more! I want to put one in my bird bath to see if the birds enjoy it. We are redoing landscaping in our yard, and I will make unique places to put them. Low to no maintenance!",

    "reviewText": "I have tried several solar fountains and this one is the best so far. It has a glass panel so is easier to keep clean, and I really like the stabilizers to keep it centered in the birdbath and the additional cleanable filters, which some of the ones I tried didn't have.It isn't as powerful as some of the others I've used, but in my case that's a plus. For a regular-sized birdbath, the higher wattage models often pump so hard the water ends up on the ground, or getting blown away in the wind, and you run the risk of the fountain running dry or low, which can negatively impact the motor. In a larger water feature or pond it wouldn't be an issue.I really love the action of the water and the fact that it runs off solar. Yes, that means it doesn't run in the dark, but it's surprising how much it does work even in limited sun or on cloudy days. I just want it to have enough movement to discourage mosquitoes -- and to enjoy the water movement.I bought one of these to replace another that had failed and liked it so much that I bought a second to replace a working fountain (2 birdbaths). Give it a shot if you want a nice water feature in your garden at a reasonable price and with no digging or wiring!",

Only works with sunshine, as expected, being solar. I think I like it more than the birds! haha They were very suspicious at first, they would fly up expecting to take a drink then halt in mid air and turn around. I am using the lowest, smallest fountain tip. I had a chickadee that loved it, took a bath and tried to hop onto the water that was being projected. :)Overall, very pleased. I'd like to see how it holds up in the winter, my birdbath is heated.",

But it wasn’t a great purchase.I received it on Mother’s Day and it ran sporadically. When it wasn’t in FULL sun it kept spitting out water.It quit running before the 30 day return window, but I wasn’t home to report to the seller. The order was delivered to my house May 2. I received it as a gift May 12. It quit working around May 25. On June 2 I came to make a return and am a day late. I can find no way to contact the seller and Amazon keeps sending me on a run around.I may have had a bum one. I would have loved to try another to see if that was the case. I had hoped to deal with the seller before posting this review since I really only had it to use less than 3 weeks, but that is not an option that I can find. So now I’d have to give them a low customer service rating also.",

    "reviewText": "I actually bought this for use as the pump for a hummingbird feeder, after watching a YouTube video \"Hummingbirds Birdbath How to Make $1 Flower Pot into EASY Hummingbird Solar Fountain\". What I didn't think about was that our place for where the hummingbirds land is actually in the shade of the back side of our house. This means that it isn't a continuous stream of water. BUT... thankfully the way this item works is that when the light is very low, it runs the fountain for like half a second... then shuts down for a second, then runs the fountain for half a second... and so on. And the power is tiny: only enough to lift the water about 5 and a half inches when the panel is in the shade.It turns out though, that this tiny lifting ability, and intermittent operation, is still perfect for my use case. It's great to be able to make a birdbath so cheap!",

I had previously purchased this pump a couple of years ago. Held up to I would say heavy use. Decided to get a new one and chose this one again. I have actually had great success with it. Has pumping power that I would expect and runs well. It does state that it needs to have full sun for optimum operation. Well, yesterday had stormy weather, rain expected. I went out on the deck and that little pump was still bubbling even with complete cloud cover. Then rain came, still kept bubbling. (attaching photos/video). Although not full power pumping, the little bubbling was quite nice. I'm ordering another one for a different area and would recommend this one for a great little garden/bird bath addition.Update 5/6/2024: This little pump keeps on working. It's had pretty much constant use since I installed it. Even in the hint of sun behind clouds it still has a little bubbler action. I'm still pleased with it and did purchase another unit, no problems with it either.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I didn’t realize this was the same one I bought last time. It lasted about 6-7 months last time I bought it, which isn’t terrible for the price. My biggest issue is the ad clearly says their solar panel will work “even with a leaf on it” compared to other brands and this is simply not true. The moment any tiny shadow is on the solar panel, even in direct bright sunlight, if a tiny corner or anything is covered it stops working entirely. I’m already finding myself moving the panel constantly to keep it in the sun so I can enjoy the sound of running water. I decided to just return it for one with a battery back up since it’s only a few dollars more and they’re built to last longer and just work better all around.The pump/suction works well but these are not built to last. My last one worked for quite a while, but it very obviously wasn’t putting out the same amount of power after only about a month, even with cleaning it often.",

    "reviewText": "Not sure if I got a bad pump or what since the reviews for this particular pump are good, but I bought this fountain in mid-July of last year (2022) to use for a hummingbird fountain. I assembled my fountain and had it in use from the end of July to the beginning of September (about 2 months) and it worked great. Before it could start freezing out, I drained the pump, cleaned it (full disassembly), and brought it inside for the winter. I brought it out and set it back up again at the beginning of April of this year (2023) and it was working great until earlier this week (less than a month), when it stopped working almost entirely, with the solar panel in full, very bright sun (upper 60's & clear skies). I completely disassembled the pump to clean it, but found nothing blocking/stopping the impeller and while the impeller wasn't spinning, it was occasionally \"flinching\" so the motor is getting power. Even though the solar panel looked clean, I wiped it off with a damp towel to see if that would improve solve the problem. It didn't. The pump & its solar panel have never been run dry, roughly treated, frozen, had the power cord kinked/damaged, or even been plugged up with debris...it just quit working for no reason.",

Its been attracting all sorts of different birds.Set up was very straightforward! Came with everything necessary. The difference spray settings are easy to interchange~ it’s nice to have back up when every so often we have to clean them out for optimal performance.The sun gives it plenty of power-lbecause it can operate 24 hours a day nonstop.It’s been on for almost 3 months and still works like new- amazing price for such an awesome gadget.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars It really does work",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was skeptical this thing would even work. I live in South Florida and despite full sun baking everything all day most solar items don't work or don't display as brigthly as the listing says - but this does! I was pleasantly shocked when I put this together and it immediatly started functioning. My bird bath sits in a part sun / part shade area and its very shallow. Despite those two aspects this fountain immediatly started working. Assembly was very easy; just insert the centering straws, adjust to the fountain width, add the pump cover and fountain tip and off it went. I appreciate that 8 heads came with it so I could choose my desired water pressure/height. Had it for a while now and still surprised at the power for a solar item. It also came with a few filter replacements for the future. I really like its automatic water level sensor that shuts it off when the water gets too low. I have had several plug-in fountains and they all burn out from constant running when the water is too low. I like this solar unit because there are no cords. The colors at night are much more vibrant than I expected which was a nice surprise. Its also very quiet - all you hear is the sound of the water trickling, not the motor which my birds like. I got this unit to keep the water flowing for my birds and to avoid standing water to attract bugs. Turns out all the wildlife like it. Yes it took them a day or two to adjust to it but now they come for water and it doesn't bother them. It's oddly relaxing to watch especially at night when the colors are most vibrant. Very pleased with this unit and I highly recommend it. Yes its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. I hope in the near future the makers add an app to this unit so you can control the colors. Right now the unit cycles through the different colors very nicey but I would like the option to choose my color in the future.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. 2023-04-09 Update - quick working. Product will occasionally spit water during the day but quits far before sundown and doesn’t light up. Started less than a week ago. It has been out in the open too, so charging isn’t the issue. Water level is the same shallower level as when it was first working fine.[initial review]Easy to put together, and works in shallow water.Best thing about it is the glow that comes off the sides at night; combined with the gentle sound of water - this is an awesome addition to circulate birdbath water and provide some evening ambiance.Would buy again based on current performance.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If it is shady the fountain doesn’t have enough power to work. It spurts on and off, and even from the shadow of your own body it will turn it off. So if you want it to function during the day, and your fountain gets shade, this may not be the one for you.However, it stores power it gains during the day and at night the fountain is shorter and the color changing light turns on. It is really nice and runs for hours and hours like that.There are many different tips to create all sorts of water displays, and it has a very powerful spray.The straw like things to keep it away from the edge of the fountain and emptying out the fountain are a plus. I do wish the straws were longer because my fountain is pretty wide and it would keep it on the center more.I love that it has a sponge filter to keep it from being plugged up. There are also spare sponges if you need to replace the original.I am pleased with this purchase.",

    "reviewText": "I have been looking for a solar fountain for our 18’ above ground pool. We live in Central Florida so we have mostly strong sunshine. From the first time I put this fountain in the water, it struggles to spray 2 inches. If just a slight shadow crosses over it, it stops spraying, and struggles to regain an 1” or 2”. I even tied it to the side of the pool with some fish line to keep it in direct sunlight. I contacted the seller and they told me the sun may not be as strong now as in the summer 🤔 After several messages back and forth and troubleshooting, the seller offered a full refund. I will keep looking! I think this would be great for a bird bath, I need a fountain for an above ground pool! Communication from the seller is a 5 star ⭐️",

The battery charges nicely and the lights and pump lasts 4 or 5 hours after dark. Just fantastic. Don’t believe any of the negative reviews. This thing is worth the money. The lights are bright and the pump is strong. It needs direct sunlight to work best. After all it is solar.",

Would be nice to fully energize it first. Surprisingly the led lights at night work without interruption. Even after a cloudy day of charging.",

It's a stupid and completely impractical design unless you enjoy searching your property multiple times a day to find the missing tubes. It's a shame because the fountain itself is decent, but the tubes are useless. Would not recommend.",

The brighter the sunlight the better the fountain works. On cloudy days, there was intermittent water spray or none at all. I ended up attaching the solar panel to an extension pole, so I could adjust the panel to always be facing the sun. Not ideal for me, if it constantly needs adjusting to maintain the flow. It would be perfect if it was located in an area that always has direct sunlight. For me, as the sun moves across the sky, my deck doesn't always have direct sunlight. I will say that this little solar panel does generate ample power. To its credit. when sunlight conditions are just right, this fountain works great with beautiful spray pattern accessories. As an experiment to keep the fountain flowing consistently without direct sunlight, I tried some alternate lighting. This little solar panel responds to a Phillips 1600 fluorescent Twister bulb. I would recommend this fountain, only if you can keep the solar panel in direct sunlight.",

We placed this into the container, put rocks in the bottom to add some interest and put the pump in and as soon as we turned the solar panel to the sun it started working. This is both good and bad as it means if the water runs dry (can happen in hot summers) the pump will still run even though dry as long as their is sun for the solar panel.So as long as you keep the water topped up or hide the panel if you don't want it running this really is a great addition to a garden.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This thing is great!! I’ve only had it a few days but so far it’s exceeded my expectations. I didn’t have high hopes because my bird bath doesn’t receive full sunlight all day. But it works just fine - even on a mildly cloudy day! And the birds freakin LOVE this thing. Within an hour of setting it up droves of them were coming to check it out. I have never really seen blue jays or mockingbirds at the bath previously but now i have a few of them visiting several times a day. The funniest are the four sparrow fledglings that spend most of every morning playing with it - just like kids at a water park! They take turns jumping into the shower and getting a good dousing and now they’ve figured out they can ride on it too LOl! A few things to consider;1. How deep is your bird bath? Mine is a good 2.5 to 3 inches. A shallow bird bath may not work as well with this.2. If the wind blows heavily or the fountain isn’t anchored and drifts to one side you may run out of water quickly. I had to play with it a bit - I don’t like using the stabilizers because they leave little room for the birds to bathe. I tried all the different spray patterns and occasionally used rocks to keep it in the best spot. In the end I found a nozzle that works well and keeps the water in the bath without needing anchors.3. I think this thing is supposed to light up at night. I haven’t really seen that yet - maybe it’s because it’s summer and the days are so long that it runs out of stored power long before it’s fully dark. This wasn’t a feature I really cared about so I don’t miss it but if you do keep that in mind.I’ve already got more enjoyment out of this thing than I ever expected - well worth the price!",

When the sun went down it was still working, and when I woke up this morning (a very dreary, sunless morning) it's still working! I'm pleasantly surprised.",

Since it involves water, I don’t even know it that would be possible. Just putting it out there for any inventor-types who might be interested. ☺️Would recommend.",

Believe me, these birds around here love this bath lol. It even works with only a couple inches or less, but I don’t recommend it. And yes, it also works with no sun, although it is not near as high, but at least it still is a beautiful fountain!!!! Highly suggest buying if you are in the market!!!!",

Sunny days see a plum a foot high. The birds love it! I like the stabilizer straws that keep it centered. The motor and filter are easy to clean. Overall, a good buy!☆☆☆☆Update-22 June 24:A large bird took a bath and broke one of the staw & brackets that keeps it centered in the bath. I contacted Sunnie in Costomer Service, June 19th. I received a replacement today, June 22nd! Faster, more friendly and efficient service I have not seen in retail! I'd buy from this company just because of their employees and \"can do it\", attitude!",

    "reviewText": "I tried a few solar birdbath fountains and they did not function if the sun was not shining brightly. They also clogged with algae when it was hot and sunny. I bought this fountain as a last ditch effort. It cost more but it was well worth it. It pumps all the time even if it is a little cloudy. The best part is you can easily clean the pump and intake. It is very easy to clean. It has a small foam pre-filter that you rinse with water to clean and running water in the hole where the fountain heads are inserted clears debris from the pump. It also has sensors that will shut the pump off if the water level drops too far. The prevents the pump from burning out. There are also small plastic straw-like tubes that hold the body of the fountain in the center of whatever vessel you are using. I highly recommend this great little solar pump/fountain.",

So, all in all, it shoots water just fine, but I feel like my birds are afraid of it. I am being patient and hopeful they will get used to it and start coming to the bath soon",

    "reviewText": "We have a water fountain that currently is not working but we have created a hack for the upper portion of the fountain using this solar fountain. By using a snow saucer in the top of the fountain and filling the saucer with water the Solar Fountain worked instantly, creating a spray and soft water sound. The Solar Fountain kit comes with various spray nozzles and tubular \"pegs\" that can be attached to the base to keep it from becoming lodged in one spot. It's a fun little addition to the yard!",

I topped up the water every few days. The multi holed spout I had to refill a few times a day!",

    "reviewText": "The powerful, small pump fits perfectly in the smallest size containers. The long wire to the solar panel is so important because the fountain stops when the panel gets in shade. My 4 fountains are in a long sidewalk garden with bushes so it’s great to be ale to raise the solar panel above and keep it in sun from dawn to dusk. There are several nozzles spray choices and some spray rather upright so water basically stays inside smallish containers. It seems the water can be rather shallow and the fountain still sprays. (My water is 1.5 inches). I used inexpensive sterlite plastic containers filled with blue glass, surrounded by succulents and shells for an OC beachy, festive, nice sounding garden. Perhaps wrap the pump with a piece of mesh or nylon stocking to keep debris from going inside the pump.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Hard working little powerhouse of a solar fountain, easy to clean!",
    "reviewText": "I've purchased two of these so far in the last few months. They work well and are simple to clean. Pay attention to how it comes, how the center part is popped out, because to clean it later you pop that center part out again, rinse off the black sponge filter and all the slits w/a hose, and pop it all back together. Couldn't be easier. (Years ago I had gotten a different brand solar fountain and I didn't realize how to disassemble and clean it since it came assembled. So I never cleaned that one. Ooops.) So in addition to being easy to clean, and just powerful, it looks to be better constructed than my old one. I do wish the manufacturers lived in a world with wind so they would understand that you cannot use any of those cute fountain attachments to make the cute high spray patterns if you have a regular sized bird bath. Yes the straw-like spacers this fountain come with are cool and helpful, but if you use any of those spray-heightening attachments your spray would be too high and a breezy day would blow it out of your fountain and empty your fountain quickly. So you just use no attachments and it's a single bubbler look where the water goes up maybe 1.5\" and back down. (This issue would exist with any brand fountain.) Then the only reason your fountain will empty is because a deer keeps visiting to drink up, but I don't mind. :-) It's now a bird & deer fountain. This seller is so thoughtful in other ways (in the good design and quality of the fountain) that I wish they wouldn't give people unrealistic expectations re. spray heights for bird baths. Now if you have some big pond, then you can play with 1' high pretty spray patterns. Anyway bottom line, this is the best brand to go with for sure due to quality, ease of cleaning, and spacer staws are cool, but do clean it somewhat regularly to maintain best functioning.",

    "reviewText": "This fountain works great in full sun. Water shooting high and making a lovely light splashing sound. The water all falls back into the basin. We have it in a large deep birdbath. The only problem is that we have to refill the water several times a day. It evaporates to dry when running. The fountain is inside in a box right now because we got tired of running big pitchers of water out all day. (This also gets expensive, and wastes water.) Letting it try to run without water will burn up the pump.",

I'm amazed to see it working even on very cloudy days, just with a much smaller spout of water. I had a large bird bath that I wanted to use it in, and for the first week used just the straws they provide to stick on the 4 sides which keep it from drifting to one side or another and spraying all the water out of the bird bath. I found on days with strong winds that it did blow the spray of water beyond the bird bath, so I bought a pack of plastic straws and stuck 4 of them on the 4 smaller straws provided. I took scissors to cut off the length of each new straw that stuck out over the bird bath. Now it has 4 long straws that keep it centered in the bird bath, success!",

Runs fine, but does require direct sunlight to operate at it's best. Otherwise we just see small intermittent \"spurts\" as it works up enough energy. Also needs fairly regular cleaning of the intake as pondlife does produce much muck! I will say one of our large Carp seems to favour the fountain as a \"hat\" and will drift around with it on it's head!!",

It added a nice little spray to my birdbath, and the birds seemed to love it! The best part is the little solar panel that I could move around to get the most sunlight on the cells. I liked the choice of nozzles, but I didn't like one much better than the others, so I just stuck with the first one I tried. I like having a little moving water in the garden, and this really seemed to keep the mosquito larvae at bay and the birds seemed to have a good time with it.",

    "reviewText": "Okay, so I was very skeptical when I read all these reviews on how great this filter/pump is, but at $79.99 it was definitely tempting enough to take the risk.Came on time, and like others I went ahead and dissassembled everything to make sure all the pieces were tightly connected. By chance, in my case it was! I had one issue though - and it was opening the UV light compartment. There's this plastic lock mechanism that's tightly stuck and I was too afraid to force it open by hand so I just picked it up and shook it around to see if I could hear a rattling lightbulb - but I didn't. (note: this was a HORRIBLE decision on my part and I was lucky I didn't damage anything). I had to google to see if I could find any \"box opening\" videos and found out that this is the EXACT same model as the pondmax sf650. (Google/youtube that name and you'll come up with a few demos as well as \"how to\" videos.)I bought this mainly to put in a large rubbermaid container for an in between fish pond. The water was thick murky green and you couldn't see anything even if you put your hand right underneath the water line. The container is in full sun and I would estimate it's about 25-30 gallons. We did a partial water change (didn't help much) and then simply put the filter in and played with the different heads. (we just use the disk shape fountain head and the others seemed to work too so I'm not clear on which head didn't work for people)The timeline for me was basically this.Day 1 - Nothing - no noticeable changeDay 2 - GREY WATER - all the green colour was leeched out and it was still thick and murky but like scummy dish waterDay 3 - still grey, but around the edges of the container you could see some clearing upDay 4 to 7 - Slowly clearing up but significantly murkyDay 8 - Can the bottom but still a bit murkyDay 11 - Crystal clear. You can see right to the bottom and there's nothing clouding the water at all.Again, I don't have a full sized pond, but just a 30ish gallon container that was really filthy and gets full sun all day. I have about 12 small 2\" and under comet goldfish in it so the bioload is quite heavy.I'm 100% satisfied with the purchase and if this thing still works in a year I'll be sticking with this brand and model.",

The fountain accessories and latches to lock the top in place are pretty fragile.Original: I used this in a 110 gallon garden pond with a couple of small koi. After a couple of years the pump would fail to start after a cleaning. The fountain attachments worked reasonably well but easily break when removing for cleaning. I had to buy spares. Now approaching 3 years of use and the pump has failed completely. I never had any indication the UV was working. There's a little light tunnel which never looked different.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok so I waited about a month to do a review of these filter/ pump combo, that also include some pretty cool fountain attachments.Now by my video and pictures you may be able to see my set up. I have formed plastic ponds not ponds with liners. Iv had them 25yrs and have used all kinds of filters. That said there's actually 2 ponds made to look like 1 continuous 1. One's 250 gallons the other 175.Now that you have the background. I bought 2 units 1 for each pond and have ran them for over a month now. And anyone who complains is either a troll or has no pond experience.The UV can ONLY be seen at night and there longer you use the filter the window that shows the uv light gets dirty abs you might not see but look close its on!When it comes to keeping pond clean and clear anyone who thinks a filter alone will do that is a fool. I use chemicals ( sludge reducer, pond clear, algea control and something to kill ammonia for my koi) too but very very little. Literally once a week only a few tablespoons to help everything else out. I also keep bio balls, the ones with foam in them in the waterfall section to promote good bacteria.Ok so as you can see I have waterfalls but use pumps separate from these units that are just stand alone pumps to move water.Now inside these filters I have read complaints about the 3 boxes inside 2 being heavy and the 3rd being very light so you must have gotten ripped off.... wrong 2 boxes contain gravel like you would find in a fish tank that uses as filtration and the 3rd contains plastic mini bio balls all of these 3 are to filter and promote good bacteria growth that upt pond needs to be balanced for fish and plant growth.Feel free to ask any questions as I am very very pleased with these filter systems and having had issues with other filters floating or clogging or just not keeping pond clear over the 25years in this hobby. These out performance of one's i.v paid double or triple for is amazing. Now you do have to take unit apart to house filter and 3 boxes 2 or 3 times a month but if you didn't have to then upt filters aren't working. After first cleaning you will see what these units collect that keep upper pond crystal clear all season long!!!",

    "reviewText": "I bought this for my outdoor fountain I made, unfortunately the design of the color mechanism sits at the bottom so it doesn't show. It was really meant for an indoor fish tank or something. So the fountain itself is great. Works great for my outdoor foundation; however, the typical designs of water fountains, it's sumerged \"under\" a layer of ceramic pots and ceramic plates as the long stem goes through the middle. So in the end, I put the color mechanism on the very top area. It doesn't fit at the top. It was only meant for the very bottom of the pipe. However, it just sits at the top as close to the water spouting out, and makes it a bit colorful. Nothing like the picture or videos. I found that in the end, this was a little pricier for what I got.",

And a bonus that the power cord detaches so I could feed it through a hole at the bottom of my fountain. I can see this working well in a small fish tank or as a replacement for an existing table-top fountain. Unfortunately, these were its shortcomings:• Power cord is too short.Unfortunately the cord is very short so I needed an extension cord.• No auto shut off if out of the water.You shouldn’t operate it out of water so you have to unplug it every time you clear out the fountain (ever night so the raccoons don’t topple it).• Suctions don’t hold.Fountain tilts to one side soaking my nearby cushions.• Power is very low.My bird bath is 23” in diameter, this looked disproportionately small. The +/- fountain height was useless.• No way to secure the lights to the pump.I had to elastic band the lights to the pump so it doesn’t float away or turn upside down.• No fountain attachments.Self explanatory.It’s being returned.",

The wire leads are about a foot long. The fluid inlet/outlet are barb style and fit 3/8 ID tubing. The mounting feet are a really flexible rubber material and should provide good cushion from vibration if it's mounted (like in an RV). It was well packaged (wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap and boxed) and came with clear operating instructions. The pump has a a pressure cutoff switch (so it can be used in a closed water supply system) that the instructions say is adjustable (by turning a screw in the pump head). My application was an open system, so I did not get to test the pressure switch. Nice pump...lots of features at this price level.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this to cycle cleaning liquids into and out of the heater core for my Jeep. I'm too stubborn to remove the whole dashboard to replace the heater core with something aftermarket and inferior. So I used this transfer pump to cycle a mixture of CLR through the core and then let it sit, cycle it for a minute, let it sit, etc.... This ate up all the rust particles. After that, I used the pump to flush clean water through the heater core and moved onto my next chemical cocktail. Next, I used Prestone's citric acid coolant system flush chemical and cycled that through the heater core with this pump. Let it sit, cycled the pump, let it sit....What I'm getting at is that neither a basic or acidic liquid being sent through this pump caused it to fail or start leaking. So that's a big win in my book. I rinsed the pump out by putting clean water through it when I was done using it and put the rubber caps back on both ends.I powered the pump with a 5 amp, 12vdc power supply and it worked just fine. The pump itself vibrates so if you have it mounted to anything that will amplify noise, you're going to heat the buzzing. It's kind of loud for what it does. That said, I am sure it's putting out at least a gallon per minute. It seemed to work just fine. I can't comment on how it would work after hours... days... years? of service... But it did what I wanted to do for my project, so it gets a good review from me.",

    "reviewText": "I'm having a good experience with this so far. I'm using it to run a vacuum aspirator for doing vacuum distillation; this outperforms low-pressure, high-volume pumps (like fountain/aquarium pumps) by a factor of 5 for that purpose, easily.This pump is rated to draw under 40 watts, so you can use any computer power supply to run it. I've wired mine directly to a cheap, spare PSU I had laying around, but I'd recommend using an ATX breakout board if you want to go this route; some ATX PSUs won't stay on unless they have a load on some of the lower voltage lines, which a breakout board should handle for you.I've been running this for several hours at a time over the last couple days, and have had no issues with excess heat; after a few hours the motor housing is only slightly warm to the touch.The only con to this pump in my application is that when operating it in an enclosed room, it's a little noisy. The sound doesn't carry through walls or anything, but the vibrations do carry through the intake and output hoses; if either of those hoses wind up resting against a box or something, it'll be quite loud. I recommend mounting this pump to something heavy and to avoid operating it on top of any table that's prone to rattling.All in all, I'm quite happy with this. It serves the purpose I bought it for at a very reasonable price point.",

    "reviewText": "It is an okay pump but nothing special. received it today and added the connector(The one I bought locally) to the wires, that I need(It does not come with a plug-just 2 bare wires). Wiring is very thin. Am guessing 22 to 24 gauge wire. Really too small for a max 3 amp motor. Had to fix a loose connector from the red wire that plugged into the motor. The connector had not been crimped enough and was loose on the motor plug. Also noticed that the motor is not completely encased. You can see that on the description page of this motor. That is not good. No matter where this motor is installed(inside or outside), dust and moisture will get into the windings. It is not a waterproofed motor and does not claim to be. I will be using mine on a 15 gal sprayer pump pulled behind my lawn mower. Dust will get into it and I have to be careful if it starts to rain while using it. As stated by other reviewers, the 2 small clamps that come with it are useless. Go buy a decent pair, if you cannot reuse the ones on your bad motor. I also have to reverse the motor/pump 180 degrees from the old bad pump-as the water flow through it is opposite. All in all, it is not bad for $22.00. Will install it tomorrow and see what the pressure is like. If I can get 6 months use out of it, I will be happy. 6/25/2018--Installed motor/pump today. Will have to buy another piece of intake line(From inside of tank to input plug on motor) due to having to reverse the motor position 180 degrees. Intake line is now about 8 inches to short. Pressure is not bad but not real great either. It will do what I need it for but would not recommend this motor. 7/22/18 edit-Pressure turns out to be pretty good. After 2 uses, had to turn down the pressure as I was going through too much weed killer to quick. Nice pump but the exposed windings are my main issue...",

    "reviewText": "This will save you a whole bunch of time and money.The pump does not run on solar directly.Battery must be turn on for the pump to work.You can however run it and charge it at the same time. How efficient that might be..... Im not sureI checked the voltage with my meter and can see the jump when the panel is plugged in.It might extend your pump past the 4 hr mark however it doesn't stop it from draining. It'll just drain slower.By doing this. Yeah definitely the battery will have a shorter life and you might end up with dead pump next month.They state that you can run it on solar only.But there is no function button for that.You are better off getting a regular pump.Soldering it to a spare solar panel or one you buy, then it'll run on solar.The pump also itself is just ok.Not very powerful honestly.It's comparable to a lower budget solar pump.At this price, this is not acceptable.Your essentially paying for a small, simple no hassle pump. Something that will last the evening party, when people come over.Then after that. No more. Have to recharge.I was hoping to run it on solar in the day. Then into the night I can use battery function.So ultimately this thing is limited.I only turn it on when I'm out there.And off when I leave.That is the only option.Also I have to disconnect the solar when I'm running battery in the day time. For the peace of mind, knowing I'm not putting extra load on the battery.I also open it up.It's bad, guys. Come on🧐 it's a cheap battery. For that price.Really for the price thoughYou can get a couple other solar pumps that will compensate for what this thing is lacking.Last point ☝️..... The solar panel wire to the the battery is Soo short. But the light and pump wire is longer.Why not make the solar wire the same length or even longer ?The company does have some better cheaper alternative. But this specific product. I say is a no go.Or maybe they just need to update it or upgrade it.Version 2 🤣It does have a cute little 🎁 box and pumps a little.So I suppose it's worth 1 star.But if it had not worked.O O zero my friend..",

    "reviewText": "Recently purchased this solar powered water pump with LED light ring to mate with our recently purchased water feature. Easy to install solar panel and pump...required only that we run the lines to/from water feature then replace provided electrical pump with this unit. Works great. LED light operating instructions very lacking although it, like the other hookups requires only that you run a line to the control box. The challenges are twofold: LED ring does not fit on pump as described in pamphlet. You must design your own attachment method. Finally, there is no singular switch to turn light on/off which begs the question, why have a seperate hookup when you could have combined it with the pump line???",

Since we get many windy days > 40 mph I’m going to need to secure it with more than gravity. Also with operating charging temp less 113F will have to turn off charging on hot Mohave Desert Days. But not a big deal for our use.Positive: arrived in 24 hrs as advertised, easy to assemble, good pressure. Appears much more sturdy than previous pumps that have survived about 18 months in our environment without a batter backup. Will update in a month or two.",

My plan was to plant flowers along the perimeter of a large pot, then put a smaller pot in the middle for the fountain. Unfortunately, the pot I used is too small in diameter (8”), so all the water splashes out of the pot and it runs out of water too quickly. It even splashes over the side of the larger pot on the bottom, which is 14” in diameter. I went through 1.5 gallons of water in about 1/2 hour. I’m bummed this is so impractical because it looked so good. I’m going to see if I can find something wide enough to contain the water so it can be reused instead of splashing out.",

When I placed it in my birdbath, which is under an orange tree and mostly shaded, it began to spout water about six or seven inches into the air approximately once every two and-a-half seconds. So far, it is working well given the partial sunlight. IN FULL SUNLIGHT, WATER WILL CONTINUALLY SPOUT UP AT LEAST TWO FEET HIGH WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. The only question is how long will it last. I rinse and refill my birdbath daily so clogging should be minimal. So far, it IS definitely worth the money. As others have said, the more direct the sunlight, the better.",

I have it in a small pond and have noticed that when it's partly cloudy, it works intermittently and spooks the birds as it suddenly starts and then stops. I plan to keep it, since I want something to disturb the surface of the water so insects won't lay eggs. It comes with a set of plastic straw-like leg attachments to keep it from bumping up against the edge of the pond. I stuck one of the legs between two rocks to hold it in place, since it always seems to drift to a spot where there's a shadow, and then it stops working. I may attach a little anchor to keep it more centered. It's great, just be aware it ONLY works in full sunlight!",

    "reviewText": "I purchased the CUF-6000 unit even though my pond holds only 600 gallons. I admit that I have too many minnows and I'm using air stones and the CUF-6000 to keep the minnows healthy.I also admit that if there's a way to get confused, I can often find it.I've had the 6000 for about two weeks. During the first week I eagerly watched my green pond water for improvement. It did improve. The filter was doing a good job collecting algae.But the improvement stopped after the first week and things started getting worse again. I cleaned the filter assembly and started to see improvement again. But there shouldn't have been so many bits of algae in the water.I began to wonder if the UV lamp was working. Cleaning everything out again, I opened the UV canister. This was also when I noticed the window in the filter box that would let you see if the lamp was working. It wasn't.Note that the instructions tell you how to open the UV canister, but they don't tell you how to remove the bulb. The bulb in the 6000 pulls straight out. I wasn't sure until I removed the shield around the socket. That's also how I inspected the switch and wiring under the base.The bulb looked okay, and there weren't any loose wires, so I wondered what else could go wrong. Below the bulb's base was a switch that would only allow the bulb to go on if the UV canister was properly closed.I decided to put two layers of PVC tape over the switch's small metal arm to reduce the clearance it senses. Mind you I very carefully made certain that the tape didn't touch anything else. It seems to me that this switch and wiring is likely not supposed to get wet. So you don't want to get tape on the base above the switch.Also note that if you get carried away fussing with this switch, the lamp might light up even when the UV canister is NOT properly closed. This could be a health risk, unless you make certain that it is properly closed before plugging in the power cord. On the other hand, if you break the switch, the UV lamp will never light up.My UV lamp works now. I am happy. I wasn't looking forward to contacting the company for a replacement. Especially since a new bulb would not have fixed my problem.I hope that the UV lamp will kill any algae bits that flow past it. Eventually it should kill all the suspended algae.Overall, I'm looking forward to being very happy with the CUF-6000. The filter really collects algae in the water, but the algae will flow around the filter if you don't clean it periodically. Now that the UV lamp is working, I'm looking forward to seeing what benefits it and the bio-balls will produce.I'm not quite as happy with the user's manual. Usually you can figure out what the manual is trying to say, but it caused me to experience some uncertainty.Take item 4 on page 02.\"4. Before all parts are installed completely, the equipment can not be plugged in.\"This statement caused me to open the unit to verify that \"all parts\" were indeed installed. They were.I've already mentioned that page 10 could tell you how to remove the UV bulb.The \"TROUBLESHOOTING\" table on page 11 could note that the UV-C lamp won't work if the sensor switch can't tell if the UV canister is properly closed. This isn't actually a user serviceable part, but it can be helped if you understand how it works.I subtracted a star for the less than clear manual and for having to \"repair\" a new product. Perhaps I'll rate it 5 stars if it performs as expected.",

    "reviewText": "Update, after 6 months:Possible replacement filter? This looks like it would fit:AQUANEAT Replacement Filter Pad Compatible with SUNSUN CUF-6011 All in One Pond Filter Sponge MediaThis still works great. We use it all the time, and have cleaned it 4 or 5 times (early on had to be more often), by hosing out the spongy filter and the rocks and plastic beads, and all of the black casing. This seems like a really good filter.As far as I can tell our UV light has never worked. I'm considering buying another bulb to see if that would help, but even without the UV light it works well. We have 5 small fish and several happy plants and volunteer aquatic snails in about a 100 gallon pond (probably 80-120 gallons depending on evaporation). We do get algae, but it only got out of control once.I highly recommend using water testing kits like the ones from Pond Master, to track ammonia, nitrates, phosphate, etc. to help figure out what's causing your issues. A filter alone won't solve all of your issues.Original review:We put this into our small pond just 4 days ago and it's already made such a difference. My kiddo had been overfeeding the fish in our natural (no filter, just plants and fish + a pump) pond, but now we can see the bottom again! We may not use it all the time...or maybe we will. It's nice that it's all in one unit - filtration and aerating the water. At first it seemed huge (relative to the size of our pond), but it's well worth it. Nice that it has multiple fountain heads to change how the water flows out.",

    "reviewText": "When I first received this filter, I was put off by the size of it. I have a very small pond (40 gallons, 10 inches deep). When I set it up using the regular nozzle, it started spraying all the water out of the pond! But then I switched to the \"mushroom head\" nozzle, and it works great! It keeps the water super clean, and my fish are very happy! I've had it for two months, and so far it is working flawlessly. I've only cleaned it once so far, and that was just spraying it with the hose to clean the crud off of the outside filter pad. I was also pleasantly surprised at how long the cord is.",

    "reviewText": "Have had a 100 gal outdoor water feature for a year. Despite cleaning the pump filters and replacing all of the water periodically within days the brown algae would make the water absolutely brown. I tried all sorts of chemicals for algae with no results. Could not see any of the rocks, fish, etc. just disgusting brown water.A friend told me I needed a UV light system. Did a lot of research and with some degree of skepticism I bought this pump about 3 months ago. The water was crystal clean within 4 days and has stayed that way ever since. I have used no chemicals since. This device is amazing.",

Even a 10% or less shading allows the pump to cease operating. The sellers ad did not disclose this very well. I was under the distinct impression it would work just like any other. The pools in working with have shifting partial shade through the day. These pumps will spurt water only during brief periods of total sun, no shadows.",

    "reviewText": "The Latest Update- when my pump began to slow down I contacted the seller for advice on how to revive its performance. The seller immediately offered a replacement which arrived in two days. The pump when working is terrific and now excellent customer service. Nice to deal with a reputable company. I am sure we will be enjoying this wonderful fountain for hopefully long time to come.Update-We have had this set up for about 10 weeks. For the first couple of months it worked great as described in the original review below. Despite having a stretch of dry sunny weather the pump has now slowed considerably. It shoots water off and on, reaching maybe 3 inches. I clean the filter and housing almost every day but even with strong sun it is fading. Very disappointing because we loved watching this especially with lights at night- usually until midnight. Now it barely makes it to 9pm. Tried to contact seller to no avail. It should have lasted longer.Original-We purchased this to place in a bird bath in our garden. This was the first time buying something like this so didn't know what to expect. As soon as we placed this in the bird bath it immediately starting working, I guess it came with the battery partially charged. The water shoots up about 10-12 inches and it comes with a variety of attachments to vary the spray pattern. On a bright sunny day it works very well but on a cloudy day the spray is weaker. Following our first sunny day I was delighted to find that the fountain continued to spray water until midnight before exhausting the battery. And the best part was that after dark it puts on a beautiful light show with changing colors. I thought it might look a bit over the top but honestly it really looks great. I hope our little pump keeps up as the birds have now discovered the bird bath and we get regular visitors.. I am also hoping for more sunny days so the show can continue.",

I put this concrete planter https://a.co/d/gzRD5Fj and this metal mixing bowl https://a.co/d/ecW7imo together to create mine. It goes well with my Asian style garden. This fountain charges the solar power, so it works in shade and automatically lights up at night. Mine is placed where it gets a lot of sunlight in the mornings and by noon it’s in the shades but it keeps on going through the night close to midnight.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am really loving this solar fountain so far! It's easy to use out of the box with simple assembly. Instructions are included. Lot of nozzles to choose from. Easy to clean when it gets clogged. Pull out the little spongey filter and spray it with a water hose. It goes all day and into the night when the little lights come on. The power is lessened when the sun goes down, but it still pumps. I thought it was a little pricey, however, overall I am very satisfied with the purchase! Beautiful in a birdbath that I bought at an estate sale!",

That’s good because the battery power doesn’t last that long. The worst part about the fountain is the weight distribution. The fountain motor and battery are all on one side of the fountain, causing it to tilt sideways. I have yet to attempt to add Wait to the other side to balance it out, but this is a design issue to be aware of.",

Right out of the box I could see that the glass covered top was superior to many other fountains that have a top that eventually peels off over time. I have typically stuck with the black fountains, but with such a hot summer, I felt the white helped keep it cooler. Very easy to assemble with sturdy straw-like pieces to help keep it centered. Needs direct sunlight for power. Extra filters to keep it running smoothly. Some of the fountains caused water to spray over the side, so it was great to have options, and I was able to find one that worked perfectly. Birds love to visit it, especially on hot days. I do tend to bring my fountain in for the winter and store in a dark place. It helps extend the life of the fountain. Perfect for bird baths or small pond. I definitely recommend!",

    "reviewText": "I laughed out loud when it arrived because it was so much smaller than I had expected, but it actually works great!My test panel is 100 watts (more powerful than this pump is rated for), so I shaded much of the panel for the first attempt. Worked fine. Then I allowed more light on it and the stream of water was quite powerful! I let it run like that for at least 20 minutes while I ran to get my wife and kids to watch what this funny little pump could do! It’s my opinion that this thing could probably run all day on a 100w panel and not have a problem, but I’ll still buy a smaller panel for it as to not overload it (or just hook up several of them to match the max 100w output). I do enjoy that it’s variable based on the wattage…makes for some interesting possibilities.",

    "reviewText": "I'm using this in a home-built swamp cooler i made so i could cool my rig on solar. It pumps a more than sufficient amount of water through the whole system. That's about 2 feet up a 1/2\" rubber tube and then another 10' or so of 1/2\" PVC and all the water need to come out the jets onto cooling pad uniformly. Just eyeballing things it appears to put as much water out on to the pads as it pushes without anything on it at all so it sure ain't weak.I'd suggest some pretty good filter mesh in such applications though because the impeller looks fragile and i don't know how resistant it would be to clogging. I just wrapped some of the blue cooling pad stuff around the base with a zip tie.Anyhow i just wanted to give folks an idea of performance. I didn't know from looking at the flow rate if it would suffice or not so if you can picture a swamp cooler capable of cooling a 30' RV then you have a good picture. Good value for the money.",

    "reviewText": "Bought this to go with a Tetra Pond Pump 325. It comes with a washable filter element (that I haven't had to clean yet). Not sure if I'll keep that filter or end up using one I can make (and dispose of) out of marine filter material. The filter attaches to the pump via included tubing, approx. 12\" long and although it is 'flexible' you cannot re-shape it to stay put. My 50 gallon round pond does not have room in the bottom for the pump, tubing and filter to fit in a straight line so I used a couple long black zip-ties to secure the filter to the side of the pump (bending the tubing into a U-shape). It all now fits nicely at the bottom of the pond.",

Not sure what those reviews were about, it had the adapters to fit the pump perfectly. I used to have to clean off the pump itself. Now I only have to clean leaves off of this prefilter, or when the flow decreases, I take out the sponge filter and clean with a hose. It not only protects the longevity of the pump, it clears the water in the pond. Great product.",

    "reviewText": "We have tried both this filter and the box filter and both work pretty well with some drawbacks. The biggest complaint is that although we use the largest 1900 gph pump, the largest corrugated pipe and that is connected to solid pvc piping, the connector from the filer to the pump is only 1” diameter. This cuts down on the flow of the pump drastically and thus makes for a smaller waterfall. The cylinder prefilter needs to be cleaned frequently! We don’t have fish to make the pond dirty, but get a lot of pine needles and pond worms in it. The box filter can go quite a long time without maintenance, but it is hard to make it stay on the bottom of the pond. I fill the box with 5 small rocks, but sometimes it will still rise to the top and cut off water intake to the pump. It is also difficult to screw it onto the pump with the rocks inside. If I cannot find a way to attach larger tubing to each of these devices, I am going to try putting the slotted cover back on the pump and place the whole pump in a mesh bag.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this product to help filter out large particulates when circulating water through my tank which I use to grow water lilies in the summer. The slits on this cylindrical filter provide a large opening to draw high volumes of water if required. The walls are about 2mm thick so they aren't as rigid as I would have liked. They bend easily when held in my hand so I have to be careful. This is why I only gave it 4 stars out of 5. Otherwise I like this design as it is perfectly suited for my setup. For my situation, this filter will placed vertically in a 70 gallon stock tank so this will reduce the possibility of the filter slits breaking if laid on its side. I had to acquire some 3/4\" (inner diameter) pvc fittings to get it to stand vertically in the tank. I connected the inlet (barbed end) to a T fitting using 1\" inner diameter hose which will then connect to a bulkhead fitting attached to the opening on the side of my tank. The water will be drawn by a submersible water pump placed inside the waterfall box hanging on the edge of the tank. Waiting for spring to test my setup. The filter insert is coarse, but sufficient to prevent large objects from getting sucked up into the water pump. Accessing the insert for cleaning can be done simply by pulling the top off or unscrewing the entire cylinder. The product also comes with various diameter hoses (short length) to allow you to connect to different sized fittings. I didn't take pictures of those.",

The pump seems powerful, I had to turn it almost all the way down otherwise it shot up 4' in the air! My pond is fairly small, 90 gallons, and probably 18-20\" deep. I have a filter box I put the pump in to keep debris out of the motor. Everything is working great and I am very happy with my purchase!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It's perfect for the water bowls I got to add between my two feeders. The birds took to it quickly (including the normally timid band tailed pigeons and mourning doves). So far the motor is strong enough to handle seeds that fall into the bowl and lodged into the filter. I just give it a light shake under water (under the sun so the motor is going) and it shoots the seeds right back out, making it easy to clean as long as I do it daily. The little adjustable extensions that keep it from moving/spinning help tremendously for the smaller birds like the chickadees and finches. No real assembly required which is always a plus, and it comes with these cute little spouts if you want a certain type of flow. Only thing is that it pretty much stops as soon as it's out of direct sunlight, but I dont mind because my yard gets consistent lighting. All in all, very happy with this purchase. Might get another one for my front yard bowl depending on the longevity of this one.",

    "reviewText": "I attached my pump to some copper tubing and a heat spreader, strapped the whole thing to a fan, and ran a line through my minifridge to make a fake AC unit (since the building has a ban on AC during the summer, too much power consumption or some other rubbish excuse). I am underwhelmed by 185 GPH, but that's all on me. The pump works great, and has continuously for over a month, stressed nearly to its limits by the length of my piping assembly. The biggest annoyance to me was the input filter. The plastic piece that holds the filter in place likes to pop off the pump and float to the surface at the drop of a hat, so I ended up zip tying it on. Good pump, probably works great when it's being used for fish or hydroponics, but the filter's a little iffy.",

    "reviewText": "This has been a great addition to my homebrewing equipment. I connect to my HomeBrewStuff 25' Copper Immersion Wort Chiller - Deluxe Package with 2x 12' Hoses, Fittings, and Faucet Adapter, submerge the pump in a cooler full of ice water, and have the chiller water return dump back into the cooler at the opposite end. Invaluable in the Georgia heat when trying to cool wort to 80F or less.The pump itself seems to be quite durable as it has had several knocks and drops by yours truly and it just keeps on chugging along, never missing a beat. It even comes with several different outlet fitting sizes and shapes to fit various needs. Even though the fittings are all plastic, they have held up very well to the aforementioned drops and ice water.If I ever have to order another pump, I may step up to the next size for a little more flow, but with the way this one has performed, I'm not sure I'll need to buy another anytime soon.Could it be better? Of course, but what can't you improve on? Even as close to perfect as I am (sarcasm), my wife would surely make an improvement or two... It could have an on/off switch so I can control operation at the pump instead of having to plug/unplug from the wall/extension cord. And you know, I think that might be the only improvement I would make.Nothing but praise for this thing, especially at the price point.",

    "reviewText": "Posted Spring 2014I bought this pump a few weeks ago. Bought an 80 year old house that has 2 ponds (one about 1200 gallons, the other 1900 gallons). This pump I bought to drain each pond so I could muck it. It drained the 1900 gallon pond in a little over 2 days (meaning it was only pumping about 40 GPH). Had to buy a different attachment to hook it up to my garden hose, but it did the job just fine. This summer, I will use the pump to water my vegetable garden directly out of the pond.BEAR IN MIND: Max Gallons Per Hour listed depend on many many variables (vertical feet it has to climb, number of bends, diameter of tubing, etc).Side note, if you have decent to large sized ponds AND you garden, drain your pond, muck it, and put the muck in your garden, it is AMAZING natural fertilizer.Update May 2015 - This product is still going strong and has done a great job for me in the following capacities:1) Moving water from one of my ponds to the other.2) Adding air quality to my ponds for my fish3) Watering my gardens out of my ponds.4) Draining my ponds.Great product!",

It's a 20-gallon container. He uses a submersible pump to keep the water moving, and his last one was about twice as expensive as this one, so he was thrilled to find a bargain here on Amazon! It arrived quickly, and worked perfectly right out of the box. It's got little rubber sucker feet to attach it into the water tank, and works fairly quietly.

Adding insult to injury, though the distributor list replacement parts for these pumps, they don't actually make any replacement parts available and the customer support is a joke. Replacement shafts and impellers are not available for these pumps, and you will need them. There is no glass fiber reinforcement in the impellers. They are just plain nylon. So they don't last long before they crack and separate from the rotor magnet. Similar pumps are available from SunSun and Atman, and there is no problem getting replacement parts for those units, and they are actually available with real ceramic shafts.",

The manufacturer had the insight to provide and ingenious device to turn it off if it runs out of water, so it won't get damaged by running dry.Sneak one into the neighbors' swimming pool and they will swear that an alien spacecraft landed in their pool!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This fountain is completely solar powered so it must be in the sunlight. There is no on off switch or a switch for night mode. Just place it in the water in the sunlight and it will do the rest.it works as a nice fountain during the day and comes with multiple choices for the type of water flow that works for you best. If the lights don't come on at night then something is wrong with it. I had to return the first one I received because the would not go on at night, but the second one I received works perfect. These look great in bird baths but they probably would look cool in a pool also.",

Also evaluating for camp / portable / zombie outbreak shower.I am using a ~ 15 gal tank, 3/8 silicone hoses for input and output. I connected it to a standard shower head, the same kind I use for normal showers. Result: basically a Normal shower, with the same flow and pressure as my everyday house shower. The 15 gal tank gives 10 minutes of shower time, which means it is flowing 1.5 GPM just like it is rated.Power comes from a small power station about 210 Wh capacity. The motor draws about 40 watts while showering. Doing the math, I could get over 30 showers per charge.Noise is not excessive; there is a buzzing or vibrating type noise due to the pump type, measured at 61 dB at 6 feet. That's in an echo-y bathroom too.The pump self-primes, and is able to pull water easily through a filter installed on the input side. No issues when the tank runs dry, it just gets a bit more noisy. The motor itself only gets slightly warm when using for this type of application, never gets hot and never feels like it is overheated even when inside an enclosure. I had no leaks anywhere, including at the hose barbs.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars An Almost Exact Replacement of the Original PetMate Deluxe Fresh Flow Pump - And It Works!",
    "reviewText": "I purchased this product to replace a previous version of the pump that was shipped with a PetMate Deluxe Fresh Flow water fountain/dish. The main difference between these two pumps was that the original had a dial knob that was used to control the water flow (see attached picture). This new one uses a slider inside the front \"filter\", and must be adjusted with the unit outside of the fountain/dish; this is not a problem once the right flow is determined. But I did prefer the ease of use of the original flow control. Note: The old front flow controller/filter could be used with the new unit, but it is not as snug as I would like.The only negative I can really state is that the rubber suction cups REALLY work well on the plastic of the fountain. Unfortunately, the downside is that when I have to remove the pump from the fountain to clean it (and I have to do that at least once a week, as my cats tend to drop food into this dish), the suction cups stay behind, pulling out of the pump. I never had that problem with the old pump. I have found that this is not too bad, as with the help of a jeweler's flathead screwdriver, I can pop them back into the bottom of the pump without much effort.I have read other reviews stating that this pump is very noisy; I have always found this pump to run silently except when:a) The pump is just turned on after cleaning and it still has air in it; I have found that after 15 seconds or so, the air is passed and the pump runs silently as expected.b) The front filter becomes clogged and cannot pass enough water; then the unit does get noisy.When normally running, neither I nor my cats are disturbed by any noises from this pump. I am definitely happy with the silent running of this unit.One other small \"gotcha\" with this new unit vs the old was the on/off switch on the cord the old pump had. This is a minor difference, as I rarely used it anyway, as I would just disconnect the cord from the adapter when cleaning the fountain anyway; an extra switch is just that, extra.Overall, I am satisfied with this replacement unit (which by the way, had EXACTLY the same model number as the old unit). It does the job, and it does it silently. And it fits my PetMate Deluxe Fresh Flow water fountain/dish perfectly, once I replaced the 1/2\" nozzle with the 1/4\" (smaller) one. My cats love using the fountain, and will no longer use a bowl unless the fountain is not available (i.e., in the dishwasher).",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars a bit different than earlier model/ works for Petmate fountain",
    "reviewText": "This replacement pump for my Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow drinking fountain, although the same model #, is slightly different but it works well. The white flow control lever on the old pump (which stuck through the hole in the fountain between the pump compartment & the water \"bowl\") has been replaced by a tiny sliding control nub on the face of the pump, only accessible before the fountain is assembled for operation (I would suggest setting it in the low flow position for the first time since it seems more powerful than the replaced pump). The ac/dc adapter power cord is about 14\" long (note: 2 prior pumps I owned broke where the hard, very thin plastic power cord meets the cord \"collar\" on both ends... I suggest reinforcing this flex point w/electrical tape). The cord from the pump to its female end (where it plugs into the adaptor cord male end) is at least 4' long (I didn't stretch it out to measure) but is missing the dial power on/off switch of the last pump (although if you need it this is very easy to re-install onto the new cord if you are at all handy). If like me you are using this for the pet fountain, 2 things: make sure to keep the cord \"clamp\" from the old cord (the black piece that holds the cord in place where it exits the fountain's rear); and twist out the plastic 1/2\" (outside diameter) \"pipe/ nozzle\" sticking out the top of the pump & replace it w/the smaller 1/4\" nozzle (packed loose in the pump box w/no instructions w/it so you at first wonder what it's for) which fits into the water flow tube of the assembled water fountain.This is a cheaper option than buying a new Petmate fountain. After a few hours of use so far, seems more powerful & quieter than previous pump.",

    "reviewText": "Update December 2019:Well, after a few of days of use, the pump motor built up some slime, which made it much quieter.So, I never did return it.I must say, it has worked out pretty well, and it has been running not stop for 5 years.I thought it died the other day, but found that there was some fun that built up in the hole where the magnet on the impeller shaft sides in. I was able to use Q-tips to clean it out, and it is good as after break-in new!So, I would recommend this pump, if it still made the same.From 2014:I am planning to return this pump. I bought it because of the good reviews, and the short lifespan of the original Pet Mate pump in my cat's water bowl. He likes to drink at the top of the slide where the water comes out, and without a working pump, that is not possible. The original Pet Mate pump was nearly silent, but did not pump a lot of water. It was enough to circulate it though. Last week, the wire developed a break near the pump motor from being forced into a 90 degree bend by the design of the bowl. They should make the wire come out the top of the pump!! Anyway, I tried putting the Pet Mate impeller blade into this pump, which made it go from a loud rattle that scared the cat away completely to a lower grinding noise that he finally approached and did drink from. But, I cannot tolerate this noise near my desk all day! I will have to go to Target and get a whole new bowl and pump for about the same price as just the pump, once I am near civilization again.",

The protective screen catches a lot of debri like feathers and such but really needs to be cleaned every other day. Easy to take apart to clean, easy to set up. Comes with 4 small clips for around the edge to hold 4 straws about 4 inches long.These are suppose to keep it from floating to the edge of the birdbath but I found that they just get pushed up on the top edge of the birdbath and get bent upward and do not work at all. I ended up using softball size rocks that kept the fountain in the middle. However, the only major flaw is that the wind catches the fountain's stream and blows it outside the birdbath, depleting the water. Will try to find something larger and deeper that the standard birdbath. Overall, a great product and a great price.",

I did not get the one with the lights. This fountain is working great for me. I did have to try different fountain nozzles before I got the right match. The ones that went higher were prettier but as the reviews said, I lost too much water. Nozzle B3 seems to work the best. I have an insert for my old concrete bird bath that is 16” in diameter and a little over 2.5” deep. If your birdbath is smaller, it might not work so well for you. I did have to cut down the little straws a little to get the fountain to stay in the middle but all is working great! This was filled at about 10pm last night and it is about 2 pm on a sunny day and the water levels are looking good. I would recommend this solar fountain.",

    "reviewText": "Got this to replace an old, basically bullet proof fountain pump that's been great, but it's oil filled and uses way more power. This is pumping to a fountain that's about 15' away horizontally and about 4.5' tall.The old oil filled pump was great and lasted over 10 years of running basically dawn to after dusk each day. But it's a bit loud, expensive and uses a lot of power. Also when they fail, they tend to leak oil all over the place.This pump is a bit smaller, a bit quieter, and most important to me, a lot more efficient. While not a huge pump, the old pump would use enough power that every 30-45 days, it used enough power to power the rest of my entire home for 1 normal day. So basically every year, it used enough to power my home for a week or so.Well this new pump is uses basically half the power of the old one and is actually more powerful.So a big win so far. Why 4 stars and not 5? I haven't owned it long enough to see if it'll hold up. The last one made it 10 years. While I don't expect that out of any of them, I'm hoping for at least several years. Also there's the question of if it'll need maintenance. The old pump never needed anything. These magnetic pumps can sometimes need to be taken apart to clean the impeller. They also sometimes have trouble starting up after being turned off once they get gunked up over time. So time will tell how hands off it is and how long it holds up.",

    "reviewText": "The pondmaster pumps are great. I keep my out door pond pump running year round. I have a small pond (only about 80 gallons) (with 4 levels) to which I add a small Laguna Power Heat heater in the winter months to keep it from freezing. I'll admit its challenging when we have a heavy snow in Northern NJ. Ice can form on the brim of the pond and cause a path for water to be drained from the pond by the pumping action. I change out/clean the foam filter about once per week. Originally I had two 250 GPH pumps for several years but recently switched to the 350 GPH. Once or twice per year I swap out the pump in order to clean the impeller. Its an easy process. The pumps are really well built. If you use them in doors in a fish tank you could run it for years without maintenance other than filter cleaning.changes",

    "reviewText": "So many of these submersible type pumps are sadly throw-away because you can't buy new impellers. We use ours to circulate CNC machine coolant, and we leave it running 24/7. After about a year, the impeller shaft wears down in its rubber bearings (probably because the coolant contains a certain amount of hard steel fines). When the wear is too much, the impeller body rubs the magnetic drive housing it runs in and eventually stops. All that's needed is a new impeller and the rubber bushings, a pretty cheap kit vs a whole new pump. And Danner sells those here on Amazon.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Okay, I've had this pump in my pond for about a year (though I take it out in the winter months). It's done pretty good for the money. It doesn't really have a filter on it, however, so I had immediate problems with clogging. This can be solved with a filter bag you can purchase on amazon for about $10. You pop the pump into the filter bag and use the string to cinch it up around the pipe and it works fine, though the bag will probably need to be cleaned about once a week depending how dirty the pond is and how much you run the pump. I have multiple bags so I can sit down and clean them all at once in a 1/2 hour session a few times during the summer.The pump comes with a couple of heads. I used the mushroom one for a while, but recently just removed it and let the water just gurgle out the top. This actually makes the lights useful in the evening. With the mushroom head the water was never illuminated, but when you just let it gurgle out the pipe, the water is lit up by the lights.The pump comes with suction cups on the bottom to hold it up, but this really isn't very useful in a pond situation, so I removed them and then used silicon glue to attach the pump to one of those saucers that sits below a ceramic pot. The saucer is heavy and wide, and keeps the pump from tipping over in the wind. The saucer and pump still sit within the filter bag without a problem.UPDATE - It's 2022 and this is the fourth year this pump has been running without a problem. I usually have it in the pond from May till November running 8 hours a day, which is enough to keep the pond clean.",

(works well in cold)My birdbath seems a bit shallow for this, as even with it filled to the brim pump still sucks in air.Clogged about 2 months after purchase. Can't figure out how to open to clean.This could be a serious issue in winter (which has not yet ended).It also aspirates quite a bit of air in my birdbath, causing erratic operation and gulping sounds.On the 2nd one I bought I got an extension tube and the mushroom spray nozzle assembled, but the parts really felt much too tight or much too loose. Have to test.Doesn't produce anything like a mushroom shaped spray, all water goes in a small \"petal\" shape in one direction or only trickles down the sides of the nozzle. When adjusting tighter, the extension tube telescopes causing most of the water to spray out of the birdbath. When adjusting looser, the water all trickles down the sides of the nozzle with no spray. Self loosens during operation, no stable setting of the nozzle.Lowered my rating from 3 star to 2 star.Lowered my rating from 2 star to 1 star, when 2nd pump also clogged less than a week after setup and couldn't figure out how to open and clean either of them.",

The only downside is the afore mentioned fish, but perhaps the fish were happier in the pet store tank than in my pond. So who really knows what goes on beneath the slow ripples of water where the led light dances gently. One thought,id maybe buy another and set it at the opposite end of the pond and create some kind of confluence just to confuse the fish. I'd really show em then. Just try and wish you were back at the pet store!",

Might be good for someone but beware it doesn’t seem to have rust resistance coating in the impeller.+ PLUSSES +* It pumps well - pushes a lot of water- MINUSES* Rust - But why would you design a WATER PUMP that isn’t protected against rust?? I tried using it as a pump for a pool but it just spews out brown rust water every time you turn it on.* noise - it’s quite loud. Not crazy loud but louder than I expected. Not sure how loud a pump like this should be but it has a high pitch whine.~ Neutral ~* Finish/craftsmanship. I didn’t put this as a minus since most people don’t really care what their pump looks like. I was surprised at how cheap this think looked. This makes Harbor Freight look like a luxury brand. The paint looks like it was a rattle can job - can scratch it off with fingernail. Hard to describe but metal parts are super thin, parts should have been cleaned up after molding/casting, etc. Just little attention to detail.* Wiring - you need to be able to wire this yourself, which may be difficult for some but clearly states in the description.",

    "reviewText": "I was using this for my fresh water tank in my off-grid cabin. It did a fair job of pumping water to the kitchen sink. The pressure switch worked great, and only turned the pump on when the faucet was open. However, it was pretty loud and the water flow was weak. I'm sure it was as advertised, but just not strong enough to get a spray at the sink. I ended up replacing it with a larger pump.But I still use this one. I use it now to pump water into the fresh water tank. I get clean filtered water from a nearby ice vending machine in 5 gallon jugs. Then I pump it up into the 26 gallon fresh water tank with this pump. It works great. The noise and speed are not a factor for this purpose. It pumps the water straight up about 8 feet with out any issues. It is a good pump.",

Not a big deal for me as my suction hose was rotting after 2 seasons. Replaced the hose with a longer piece to reach the other port and was good to go. Performance was a little better than the original. Ran 4 tanks or 60 gallons through it the first use. Price was worth it compared to buying a new sprayer(20% of a new sprayer), we'll see how it holds up. For comparison, the original lasted 2 seasons for a total of maybe 15 tanks. Hoping to get at least another season from the sprayer.",

I have literally had these fountains for about 2 months and I never have just left them outside when I'm not home to watch them bc in the beginning they worked ok and they worked somewhat the way they were supposed to but in-between use I would always bring them inside so the sun wouldn't just hit them and the motor would run and tear them up. I have had mine in the house until this morning and I decided that I would put mine in some water this morning and it would just spit and spurt a little and now it has stopped working all together. I mean I would have been ok with them at least working for this summer. But it's not even been in use for a total time of 1 week and it's not working.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Failed out of the box! [SEE UPDATE]",
    "reviewText": "Installed in combo with a brand new AquaSurge 4000 pump in minutes, no tools except Teflon Pipe Thread tape as advised. Initial trial run was great! No leaks at joint, Aquascape Signature Series Skimmer or 2\" tubing.HOWEVER, when pump was off to check plumbing and Biofalls for leaks the Biofalls water level dropped 75% over a 8 hour period. Usually indicating the check valve was not preventing backflow. But I assumed we had a leak outside the main pond since the Aquascape Dual Union valve was brand spanking new. So I dug out behind the Biofalls so to inspect the bulkhead and connections. My 2' hole was dry and so were the connections. So I figured the worst, a crack some where along 75' of buried 2\" tubing.Instead of inspecting the tubing we continued to clean out the 5,000 gal Koi pond for maintenance. After sump pumping the pond my wife noticed water still trickling heavily from the skimmer. The Aquascape Skimmer is brand new, so this means the new Aquascape Dual Union Check Valve had to be defective. I will return and exchange for a replacement. I will follow this review after installing the replacement next week.6/9/20 UPDATE:The replacement arrived the next day after my return request was placed!!!Before installing I did a very basic leak test. I blew into the discharge side - No pressure loss. Upon removing the defective valve I repeated this same test method - definite pressure loss.After installing the replacement I turn the AquaSurge 4000 pump on to fill the Biofalls, then shut pump off. This time there was no water level drop in Biofalls, meaning no back flow in to the pond. EXCELLENT!SUMMARY:IMO this model is very pricey, HOWEVER, it makes for the perfect fit when using brand new Aquascape AquaSurge pump and brand new Aquascape Skimmer. No guess work, fittings and connectors match perfectly for a complete new Aquascape upgrade.IF you are perhaps using different brand pumps and/or skimmers it may be best to use a more simpler Check Valve assembly to give you more adaptability for your particular installation.If this unit fails I will again update my review accordingly.",

    "reviewText": "My experience with Aquascape products and the company has been nothing short of a nightmare. I cannot emphasize enough how strongly I advise everyone to stay far, far away from this brand. From the low-value products to their abysmal customer service, dealing with Aquascape has been a colossal waste of time and money.Adding insult to injury, their customer service is nothing short of a joke. When I attempted to contact them about the products I received, I was met with an infuriating run-around. It seemed like nobody knew what was happening, and they couldn't provide any reasonable solutions to rectify the situation. Their lack of accountability and disregard for customer satisfaction was utterly shocking.In an industry where customer satisfaction should be a top priority, Aquascape appears to be more interested in making a quick buck than in providing quality products and services. My unfortunate experience with this company has left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a firm resolution never to support them again.I highly recommend looking elsewhere for aquatic products and services. There are plenty of other reputable companies out there that genuinely care about their customers and deliver top-notch products. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment by steering clear of Aquascape.I wholeheartedly suggest a 100% avoidance of Aquascape products and the company itself. Don't waste your money on their low-value products, and definitely don't bother hoping for any semblance of helpful customer service. Choose wisely and invest your money in a brand that values its customers and delivers on its promises.",

I checked the hose and it’s not frozen, although it isn’t quite cold enough for that. I will change the hose out and see if that makes a difference.",

Despite both pumps being 2100gph, the old pump was clearly pumping more water. Not the worst problem, but a noticeable one, to say the least.I could look past the slight lack of power in comparison, but in addition to that, the front plastic filter piece that covers the impeller was only loosely held onto the pump and would fall off if the hose was bumped hard enough.That was a solveable enough issue, but it wasn't the worst issue.Within the first few months I had noticed the water wasn't flowing like normal, so I unplugged the pump thinking debris had been blocking the filter, but it was clear. So I checked the impeller to make sure there was nothing in it and it was also clear. So I checked the filter and it was also clear. Cable checked out fine, so I put it back in the pond and plugged it in. It must have been on the cusp of failure, because as soon as I plugged it back in, it made an audible sound through the water. So I yanked it back out and noticed the impeller was just completely broken",

The pump is reliable, runs quiet, moves a large volume of water, and, most of all, is energy-efficient. I recently had an issue with the pump impeller shaft and considered purchasing the same replacement pump until my brother reminded me of the pump's internal part warranty. Usually, I am skeptical about contacting customer service regarding warranty issues. But I decided what do I have to lose. So I contacted the Alpine customer service department via email along with a few photos regarding my pump issues and my proof of purchase. To my surprise, I received a response within approximately 4 hours from when I sent out the email. The response was from a customer service representative name Judy D. She was extremely helpful and genuinely wanted to assist me with my pump issues. To make a long story short, my pump issues had been resolved in a timely fashion, and the process itself was a breeze. They definitely stand by their products with a satisfaction guarantee during the warranty period. I am an Alpine customer for life. What a great company, as well as amazing customer service! Thanks to employees like Judy D.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I’ve had this pump running 24/7 for 2 months now and I’ve had absolutely no issues what so ever. No clogging, flow of water is steady and does not change. My pump is installed insode a pond box which helps stop large debris from depositing inside the filter chamber which is key to a low maintenance pond in my opinion! The pump is hooked up to a 5 foot hose running about 4 feet in height from the water fall box to the pump box! All in all this pump is well worth the money! Great product",

We felt safe and for added insurance also bought the 4 yr. service plan ( a no brainer ) As previous reviews stated, the set up is so easy. We were in awe watching our pond ( a 40 X 100 foot) water show.... the biggest bonus is the lights at night...impressive...and Fantastic !!!! Very well pleased... I did also go the local hardware and purchase a timer for the power source which makes it no problem remembering to turn on and off.. I read the bad review from the guy who said he bought a dud, I really think the worry free 4 yr replacement plan is well worth the small fee..",

    "reviewText": "I'm quite happy with this fountain. It was easy to set up and looks great.Some of the higher end fountains can be left in over winter, but the instructions require that this one be removed. That cost it one star.Customer support helped me with my one issue. The fountain was not floating level so the spray was tilted. They correctly diagnosed that I had the fountain too far from shore and the power cord was tugging on the pump. I moved it a few feet closer so that the power cord was hanging straight down and now the fountain is level.",

    "reviewText": "I've had this running non-stop in a small pond for over three years in a harsh tropical environment and it's still running strong! I don't use the lights, because of the silt in my pond, they quickly get too dirty to see. I have to clean out the fountain head occasionally as the silt builds up in it, especially if my pond gets really low. I switched to the head with the larger holes which doesn't get as much build up as fast. I've tried a few different fountain pumps and even some expensive aerators, but this has held up the best. I will definitely buy again, but hopefully it will not have to be for another few years! Customer service for this company is also awesome. Highly recommend this fountain pump and the company from my experience!",

Have tried to reach customer service since July and have even tried to reach them through Amazon. One time in July they did responded saying photos were too large. I resent the photos and we can not get anyone to contact us since. This pump is supposed to have a 3 year warranty with the option upon registration to extend the warrant for 2 additional years however I can't register our product due to product not listed in options. Beyond frustrated with this company! Save your $500 and either don't buy a pump or go elsewhere!!",

    "reviewText": "Works well and quietly, powerful enough for a nice water feature a few feet high. I chose this one because I really needed the pre-filter since I have plants in my mini pond, which is set up in a plastic lined wine barrel. The previous filter had to be cleaned every couple days when it got clogged with leaves and mud. This lasts a couple weeks before needing to be cleaned, but unfortunately there is no actual way to secure the sponge pre-filter onto the intake tube. You have to choose between the protective cage which would still let plenty of debris in, and the sponge attachment which really easily slips off while you're placing it into the water. I would have given the pump itself 5 stars and the sponge filter 3 stars, because it would work but it falls off so frustratingly! And of course once it falls off under water it sucks up some water hyacinth roots and I have to re-clean the whole thing. I find that if I shove the pre-filter on while the output valve is on low, and then turn it back to high, it sort of pinches the sponge and helps hold it on better than nothing, but I feel like there should be some threading on the pieces to keep them secure.",

Spring Summer and Fall as long as we keep water in, it runs. Have to clean the filter and the impeller/armature but it keeps on running. The bearing ends did get out of shape, bearings worn. It was still pumping. I got a new pump cause I like the way this one held up. All the bird and squirrel and chipmunk and deer and others drink and enjoy. I will buy again.",

The installation process was made incredibly easy thanks to the detailed diagram included in the manual. The instructions were clear, and the layout helped me connect everything correctly on the first try.The pump delivers excellent water pressure throughout my restaurant which has made a noticeable difference, especially in the Sink and with appliances like the washing machine. The flow is consistent, and the pump operates quietly—no loud vibrations or noise.What I appreciate most is the durability and efficiency. This unit is clearly built to last, and it hasn't missed a beat even with continuous usage. I also noticed a significant improvement in energy consumption, which is always a plus.If you're looking for a reliable, powerful, and well-documented water pressure pump, this is definitely the one to go for. I highly recommend it for anyone in need of better water pressure or a straightforward installation process!",

I have it mounted in a vertical orientation (inlet on top, outlet pointing down) which works well. The pump does not like air bubbles and will cavitate (no work is done, e.g. no flow) if there is any air in the system. The pump uses a very low amount of current so I can run it off my solar batteries when the grid is down (happens frequently during the winter). The pump is used to heat my hot tub using a heat exchanger. It works perfect. The life span for me is about 5 years of running a few hours a day. I just had to replace it due to a leak that shorted the control board in the pump housing. The pump gave excellent service for those 5 years.",

The nice thing was soon as the morning sun hit it it was up and running just to the amount I wanted so as not to throw out very much water. I would probably buy the one with the larger battery if you want it to go longer in the evening or have the LED lights on it. I would buy it again.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. UPDATE: After more days of use, I’ve found that the pump requires more sun than it needed the first day. It pulses with intermittent ejection while not enough solar energy. The first day, it worked well with total overcast and even while snowing after batters run down.Original post: Works with total overcast and snowing after battery totally depleted overnight!!!! I am so surprised at how little amount of solar is required to make this pump work. The unit stopped working in the dark last night after the battery ran out, but the pump is working well with overcast skies and snowing. (See video.) I am using a nozzle that sprays horizontally to avoid any wind blowing a higher fountain of water over the side of the dish. I don’t know how strong a more vertical nozzle would spray with this amount of energy, but this pumps ability to pump this strongly with this weather is incredible. The temperature is 37F now, but I will have to move the pump indoors to protect it when temps approach freezing later today.The plastic tubes on the side do a good job keeping the fountain in the middle of the water bowl. However, the clip attachment is rather weak and can be easily knocked off of the pump base if mishandled. I would be inclined to epoxy the clips to the base if the pump were in a larger dish or a pond where the pump would be bumping on and off its surroundings.I like that the pump has an auto-shutoff if the water source is interrupted by depletion ir filter clogging. By the way, the filter is porous enough that fine debris will nit obstruct it unnecessarily. Extra filters are included and filters are cleanable.I would definitely recommend this battery backed up pump with its centering side tubes over the one sold with the pictured bird bath.The instructions are not the most detailed and are not written in the best English. There is no mention in the instruction booklet of how to best eliminate the air when placing the pump in the water. On the Amazon site, it is mentioned to submerge the pump and rapidly evacuate the air. No further detail is provided. I tilted the pump back and forth and got sufficient air out, at least for the horizontal nozzle to work without interruption. The vertical nozzles were more challenging.Only three securing ground spikes rather than the advertised four spikes were included. That’s not a problem for me though, as I placed a large rock on the pedestal’s base as many suggested, in addition to filling the shaft with gravel. I doubt that the spikes would be sufficient in heavy wind or if a large bird or squirrel were to join the party.I would give this pump 5 stars, except for the shortcomings mentioned in the last two paragraphs. It’s still the best pump that I was able to find and operates impressively.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pleasantly surprised that it actually works. Its a little overpriced for what it is, but its cute and it works. Set it out first sun, took about 30.minutes of full sun for it to produce a strong fountain. It does work a little lower stream in partial shade. Only a bubble in late sun or shade. Package comes with a small selection of nozzles & replacement filter. Cut the 4 intake poles to fit. An entire 10 page booklet of convoluted assembly graphics is overkill...only need four written ones. Choose nozzle, place in center, attach 4 rods. Set in bath. Overall, neat little solar powered lawn gadget. I like that the black doesnt add sun glare, but I suppose the colored ones might also look pretty in the water play. I liked it enough to order another one. 4 stars only because of the price, I was expecting a little ...er...fancier gadget. Its basic. But it works.",

I called all the local hardware and garden stores, hoping to find the same brand.

    "reviewText": "Hello, I have purchased Danner pumps in the past for numerous pond and bubbling rock features. These pumps are by far an industry leader for quality and longetivity. I install these in ponds, bubbling rocks etc.. in the springtime and remove them before the frost sets in for winter. Every spring a disassemble the impeller housing and inspect the wear and tear and clean ANY deposits that may have gotten onto the pump. I also put a small dab of \"vaseline\" where the impeller meets the top cover and bottom .Even though the vaseline disappears in a few seconds/minutes this ensures easy startup for spring. I like these pumps because \"they work\" and they last if taken care of. The ONLY moving part is the impeller REMEBER when reassembling the impeller cover do NOT over tighten the screws or you WILL strip them. Snug us best and nothin more!!! I purchased this pump for a 3foot tall bubbling rock with a 3/4 hole. I use a \"rubber\" hose feed up the rocks hole. Should be plenty enough lift for this project Good Luck all",

That being said it fell apart after 28 days(flotation separated from unit on both sides), just in time to return. No answer from the seller, so not sure if they have customer support. Going to try another to see if it lasts. Update: They reached out and were very helpful with solving my problem. I have adjusted my review to reflect their wonderful help and solution.",

    "reviewText": "The lights on this fountain are amazing. The fountain seems to be durable. The filter does at time become clogged. That means it's doing its job. If you push the unit up and down in the water and create suction you can free the debris without using a new filter.The downside to this unit is that it needs constant direct sunlight to operate at full blast. At night the unit switches to it's battery and the lights turn on and the fountain operates fully until the battery runs out. Our backyard has a fair amount of shade thoughout the day so it doesn't have enough time to charge. It does enough to churn the water so it doesn't allow the water to be ome stagnant.Oh and on windy days the pump is so powerful that the spray will blow the water out of the bath. Good news is that the fountain has a shut off when there is no water so it will not burn out.We would definitely buy this product again. Next year we are going to buy a birdbath and this fountain for our front yard as it has full sun all day out there.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Would have been 5 stars when new because it looked so nice; but, it hasn’t lasted as it should with the intended/original features.I loved this last summer when I got it. I was happy that I spent the extra money over previous fountains. The colors & fountain at night were truly beautiful.BUT by the end of the summer, the lights didn’t change like before…. Not in a consistent sequence that lit up the water spray as colors changes. It still worked as a fountain & lights did come on, but disappointing by the end of the summer. It’s like the lights were dying (fizzling out? Shorting?). A couple of the small light sections (not sure what to call them) don’t change color…. They’re colored, just don’t change or project.I’m still using it. I cleaned it (as I’ve done before). Lights come on but they’re hit or miss & nowhere near as ‘magestic’ as before. It was so cool!I want another one because it made me happy last year, but I don’t want to spend the money every season.I’m compelled to write a review now because I was initially very happy with the purchase, but when I see it now I’m disappointed. I understand there was a year warranty & I missed that window, so obviously my neglect there.I’m sharing pics from last year. The fountain would be all one color, then change to the next color. Now (pic/video taken 7/20), the fountain works, but the lighting isn’t what it was.So, I’m conflicted in my recommendation…. Really nice/fun at first, but won’t last.",

    "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this barrier bag. Hate the sponge things small pond pumps come with to cover the intake, I'd rather not fiddle with slimy sponges non-stop. I don't want to run the pump with an uncovered intake, as I'm pretty sure my filter would have a lot of ground guppy in it if I did. This was just right for what I needed, brought it out of the pond a couple times this summer and sprayed it out to clean it, it's flexible, sturdy, low maintenance and didn't cost a fortune. I bought a small rectangular plastic basket from the dollar store, removed the side mesh and the bottom, and used the resulting open frame to form a cube inside the bag to keep the intake away from the mesh. While some adventurous guppy fry may have taken their final swim, the mesh openings are large enough not to constantly clog but small enough to protect the adult guppies, loaches and my goldfish. I have a preformed 300 gallon pond shell, so this isn't trying to sift out a ton of bottom crap as might be the case with a 'natural' pond.",

It's been in place for around a year now, and I can happily report that there have been no more frog deaths! Additionally, this bag helps to keep out larger chunks of debris and gunk that manage to slip past my other filter media. It's a good \"last resort\" for keeping muck out of your pump. My only minor complaint is that I wish the bottom of the bag were flat. The seam of the bag runs right through the middle of the bottom, and it sometimes makes the pump a bit wobbly on the bottom of my skimmer box.I can definitely recommend this item overall.",

    "reviewText": "This may not be a fair review, but I can only report my experience and let the readers reach their own conclusion. I have a 4,000 gal. pond, presently with no vegetation. I do live in an area subject to substantial wind blown debris (leaves, seed pods, mown grass, etc.) too numerous to effectively skim from the surface. Therefore, the pump is clogged with both large and small particles and must be cleaned on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. My pump is a Little Giant, rated at 3,200 GPH., with two discharge ports, one to the filter the other directly to the waterfall. This splits ths discharge into two equal, more or less, quantities of 1,600 GPH. The filter's internal parts further reduce its discharge to about 1250 GPH.I was sure bagging the pump would solve the large debris problem, but immediately on enclosing the pump and placing it back on line, the discharge was about one-half its unbagged quantity. Seems the mesh of the bag in itself was acting as a blockage by small debris. I left it to run for the next 24 hours. That evening we had a tremendous storm which resulted in flooding the yard and washing soil and other debris into the pond. Later I noticed the pump discharge was a trickle. When I lifted the pump from the pond the bag was completely covered with soli particles which were blow or washed in by the preceding storm. Good news is that the pump itself was clog free, so I guess I could say the bag did its job to protect the pump.End of story, this may be the answer for those with a small, debris free pond. If you do decide to bag you may want to increase your pumps discharge. if you are in an area such as I, and/or you cannot increase your pump's capacity, you may wish to avoid the bag. For a small pond, easily skimmed of debris, the bag might work.",

My pond is full of plant life and, prior to putting the pump inside the barrier bag, I'd have to remove debris at least every-other-day.Some other reviewers referred to problems with the barrier bag clogging up and inhibiting pump flow. That may be a true for a high volume pump. However, its not an issue at all with a relatively small, low throughput pump.I've very glad that I got this.",

I run three in my larger pond tank, and one in my baby koi tank.. The only thing I wish they would change on this pump, would be to give you an option to hook it to an in pond skimmer, on the intake area.. I wish the intake could be run as it is with the grill cover.. But also had a 1 1/2' or 2\" male, screw on connection, on the intake as well... Using to intake for the skimmer, you do have to use several layers of protection for the pump.. But it is a great skimmer/waterfall pump as well..",

    "reviewText": "I got this product last year (2015) and another one this Feb (2016). Both were the 396GPH models. The first one was purchased in 2015 for use in a large 500 gallon pond for aeration and a little bit for aesthetics but mostly to keep the water clean and free of bugs. We run it about 4 hours every evening from 5-9pm and sometimes a lot longer in the weekends. The second one runs a small nft system running water through 1/2\" sprinkler hose with branch 1/4 inch drip irrigation lines. Works great here as well, this unit runs 30 min every hour and has held up well so far.Both units came withthree-.75\" Barbed x .75\" Threadedtwo-.5\" Barbed x .75\" ThreadedNozzle x .75\" ThreadedPre-wired 69 inch 120v power cordUnit contains a removable reusable and cleanable filter.ProsVery quiet, so quiet in fact that you may not even hear it running even close by.Very efficient, I checked with my kill-a-watt meter and it says it uses only 13 watts or so most of the time it is running.Pump can lift almost 6 ft (linear) with a 1/2\" tube without any kinks or bends. The unit works best when it lifts no more than 5 feet from the bottom of the pumpVery tolerant pump, I even ran it off a 30 watt solar panel with a small 100 watt inverter. No problems here either.ConsWater volume goes down almost exponentially with heightNot the cheapest pumpOutdoor usage where pump sees constant sunlight can make the shell somewhat brittle",

    "reviewText": "I purchased 4 of these pumps. The first one worked perfectly from the start and has continued to run faithfully for two weeks. The second only lifted the water 4 feet. This pump needed to be unplugged and plugged in several times before it would lift the water the full six feet of the tower, a defect which was evident within a few hours of installing it. I purchased these pumps for hydroponic towers, so it is imperative that the water flow regularly. I was able to provide nutrient solution to two hydroponic towers using one pump for a while, but this pump would be likely inadequate for any long term configuration involving more than one tower.The last two pumps seem to work fine, but each has only run for a day or so, I needed to test both just in case another one failed. I have these pumps on a timer - 15 min. on/15 min off.I returned the weak pump and was given a prompt refund. Replacement was not an option, so I had to purchase a replacement. I am keeping one for a spare, in case one of the working pumps dies. I don't know how long that will be but I will post an update when that happens.The specifications on the packaging state that the maximum height this pump will lift water is 6.5 feet. Two of the pumps are very quiet, one is a bit louder, but not distracting. The package contains barb adapters (1/2 inch and 5/8 inch(?)) for intake and outflow. Removing the housing and filter provides access to the intake where the adapter can be screwed in. This pump fits just fine in a five gallon bucket with room to spare and provides a good flow of nutrient solution to the top reservoir for distribution to the plants.",

Does a great job of this (using a lot less water than the original design of the Python). Good water flow to remove water at a reasonable rate. Only issue is the provided attachments to the pump, the only one that easily fits the existing Python tubing has a side nipple (last connector in the last photo of product). Connected a small piece of tubing with a small check valve closes it off well enough. Has a sponge filter built into the intake, but can be removed and any of the connectors can be added to the intake. Plan to take advantage of this to attach a hose to the intake to provide more control of where the water is being sucked up.",

VERY FIRST TIME.I put it back on then gently pulled and popped off.When I went to put it in my reservoir, it popped off while I was sitting it in the water.That says it all. It's a poorly constructed product. Period.This will be the last EcoPlus brand product I buy.Edit: Tried using it and boy am I disappointed. It couldn't pump nutrient solution 6 feet away and 6 feet back and because of that, my water temperature got too high. I had to manually lower it.This means the pump failed in every possible way, short of at least \"turning on\" when plugged in.When I checked in my reservoir, the front cap and filter had fallen off. It hasn't been touched and there is no movement inside the reservoir other than air stones making bubbles on both ends while the pump stays in the middle.TL-DR: This is absolute crap. It's an underpowered, poorly developed pump made from lowest-bidder parts and aimed at making as much money as possible off YOU, the consumer.",

I tote 35 gallons at a time in a container on the back of a side by side, and transfer it to another container next to the garden. I had a different cordless water pump that was crazy slow and just wasn't cutting it. I took a chance on this, and it is AMAZING. It transfers the water in my 35 gallon tote in maybe two minutes vs. about 30 minutes with my other pump. This is silent, quick, and easy to operate. I would definitely purchase this again. Highly recommend!!!",

    "reviewText": "This water pump is a great cordless option for a variety of outdoor and household water-pumping tasks. I was impressed by its powerful flow rate, it was super easy to pump water from our pool. I plan to use it on our fish tanks as well, and I'm sure it will work just as good when I do. It works with a 20V dewalt battery and because of the submersible design, it safley allows you to use it even in deep water, without the risk of damage to your drill battery. The fact that it is cordless along with the included adjustable hose fittings, it provide versatility as well as functionality. The battery life seems decent, although it will depend on your level of use. I found that it worked well when emptying and refilling our kiddie pool. The automatic low-voltage cutoff is a nice safety feature to protect your Dewalt battery. My only minor complaint is that the plastic construction feels a bit lightweight, so I'd hesitate to use it for any heavy-duty jobs. But for its intended purposes, this pump performs very well. It's a handy cordless tool to have around the house in case of flooding and for a number of outdoor activities and jobs.",

This is false. There is no standard off the shelf adapter to convert the discharge threads to a garden hose (MHT) male fitting. The only solution is to buy a sacrificial hose and attach to the barbed adapter included with the pump. I used a 15' 5/8\" $15 garden hose from lowes attached to the smallest adapter. Pressure was barely adequate for washing the dogs.",

    "reviewText": "This pump kills it. If you want to move lots of water then get this pump. I'm sure this thing is pumping at least 3000 gallons an hour and thats after my filter and long hose leading to the other end of the pond. Is it going to last I don't know I just got it a few days ago I'll update in six months. A good tip to keep pumps going for along time is keeping debris from going in your pump. Build a pre filter, or use a sponge to rap around it or something and don't let the impeller get gunky. Clean it regularly cause if you don't it burns pumps out. Beware if you have small pebbles or sand and dirt in your pond and you don't protect this pump it will surely suck them in because of the amount of water it moves. Update lasted six months for me I'll be ording a back up pump. This thing is awsome still running strong. Worth every penny. My pre-filter I built out of a milk crate and sponge works perfect to protect this pump as well.",

I'm using mine to move dirty rainwater off of my land. So it's getting a beating but fairing very well. Four stars because the maximum PVC fitting seems to be an inch and a half. I guess you could fit 2 in hose but it's coming out of an inch and a half hole so seems pointless. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a little workhorse and I'm glad to have it.",

    "reviewText": "I ordered this pump in a crunch after my main filter and waterfall pump started to fail. My main pump is $450+ while this pump was $70. The quality and design is quite evident although both pump's gph flow about the same rate. I cannot comment on longevity as I just got it, but I can say I would trust this pump for intermittent utility use, but not my main pump for long term years of service. Looking at both impellarsxfrom each pump, its definitely not as durable looking.I might suggest further protecting this pump with a screen bag to filter out more larger debris to reduce impellar damage for long term. Hopefully the motor lasts longer than a couple years. The warranty is 1.5 years....which is decent for the price point, but my main pump has a 3 year warranty and lasted 9 years. I would recommend this pump for certain application and may buy another for water movement, but not as my main pump.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Bought this pump 2 years ago. It has ran 24/7 since I installed it, all year including winters. The pump has very good flow while pumping water vertically a little over 6 feet. The pump sets in the deepest part of the pond which is just over 4 feet. A rock came loose (dogs playing around pond) and fell on the pump. That knocked the blue cap loose and caused the pump to quit pumping. Once the cap, which was unbroken, was placed back on the pump, the pump worked like new. After 2 years I can not tell any difference in the functioning of this pump. If it ever stops working I will purchase this pump again.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. (ORIGINAL Review September 2016) Strong Output. Solvent safe. Replaces the cheap Harbor Freight pump.See the attached video for my installation into the Harbor Freight parts washer.Installation Notes: The valve above the oil filter serves 2 purposes. 1) Keeps the fluid from siphoning out when you change oil filters. 2) Allows you to adjust the flow rate from full-blast down to a dribble. The full-blast flow rate from this pump is actually so strong that it can cause splashing. Dialing it back just a bit with the valve makes for a much neater operation.Not shown on video. I drilled 3/16 holes in the base of the washer legs to screw the legs to the dolly. Drill these holes while the washer is upside down before you fill it up with solvent. Also, I replaced all fiber lock-nuts and machine screws in the switch box with aircraft grade hardware. Make sure you reinstall two good grounds inside the switch box. I re-crimped high quality lugs onto the ground wires and used solder.The Little Giant pump works great. The big unknown is long-term durability. I will followup on this.UPDATE June 18, 2018: Little Giant pump continues to work perfectly. Output flow remains strong. Original solvent in the tank is now dark from old oil and grease forming on bottom of tank... however, the filtered fluid passing through the oil filter comes out of the flexible nozzle clean and almost clear. This is a great modification!UPDATE July 15, 2021: Still running strong. No issues after 5 years.UPDATE December 2023: Still running strong after 7 years.",

I thought it would be a cheap unit that would not last. After my homemade pump set up started to leak solvent, I went ahead and ordered one of these. It is absolutely a quality unit, surprisingly heavy and well made. It pumps with adequate pressure and volume and is super quiet. Make sure you install the supply wire in a liquid tight conduit so the solvent can not attack the conductor insulation. I expect years of service from this unit and am very, very happy with the purchase. Thanks",

So I am now utilizing a separate drain barrel with the pump under the tank and working great for a month so far. I do expect this pump to last simply because it made for better chemicals like kerosene.Instructions are a bit unclear so you need some basic knowledge of how to hook it up. instructions say to use liquid tight metal conduit, I would love to know where to find the fittings and everything because no one carries that. Use iron/galv pipe with sealant for the elect run. As for the flow outlet, the size and thread is the same as a sink line. A pex outlet would have been better, the threaded end is plastic and strips easily, be careful.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted to buy this for a friend’s birthday so I bought 2. I wanted to try it out myself first. It’s so easy to assemble, and even easier if you don’t want to put the arms on. I took them off because it didn’t feel like they were necessary in my birdbath, plus it left more room for the birds who like to splash around in it. I haven’t tried all the sprinkler types yet because I liked the one I started with. It really works as long as there’s water beer it, and the sun is shining. The lights stay on for a short while after dark. But it’s long enough to enjoy. It’s simply nice. And the birds aren’t afraid of it like I wondered at first.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Easy to use.Worked really well for our little home made deck fountain. Solar like was bright and lasted awhile and fountain stream was impressive in full sun.Unfortunately, it Just suddenly stopped working after 2 weeks. We had regularly rinsed out the filter and made sure there was always enough water in the container.Giving it 2 stars because when it worked, it worked perfectly, but only 2 stars since it only last 2 weeks. And several of those days were rainy and dark so it wasn’t evening running.Update July 21, 2023Customer service reached out after seeing my review. They sent me a replacement and so far, so good! It’s been working as expected and I really love this little thing. Birds even accidentally flipped it over and when I turned it right side up it continued to run.If the product lasts the rest of the summer, I would feel comfortable changing my review from 2, to 4, to 5 stars.Definitely worth a try since the company is standing behind their product!",

    "reviewText": "As a mom who loves a beautifully maintained garden, I couldn't be happier with the Yzert Solar Fountain. This 3.5W floating solar bird bath fountain is a delightful addition to our outdoor space, and it brings so much joy to our family and visiting birds alike.**Full Glass Panel Design:**The full glass panel design is not only elegant but also highly efficient. It adds a touch of sophistication to our garden, and the glass surface ensures optimal solar absorption, keeping the fountain running smoothly throughout the day.**2200 Capacity Battery:**The 2200 capacity battery is a game-changer. Even on cloudy days, the fountain operates seamlessly, thanks to the stored solar energy. This reliability ensures that our bird bath remains a lively focal point, attracting birds and adding a tranquil water feature to our garden.**Fixed Rods for Stability:**The four fixed rods are a fantastic addition. They keep the fountain securely in place, preventing it from drifting around the bird bath or pond. This stability is especially important in windy conditions, and it ensures that the fountain remains a consistent and reliable water source for our feathered friends.**Colorful Water Display:**The colorful water display is absolutely enchanting. It creates a magical ambiance, especially in the evening when the light hits the water just right. Our kids love watching the vibrant water patterns, and it has quickly become a favorite feature during outdoor playtime.**Versatile Use:**We've used the Yzert Solar Fountain in various spots – from our bird bath to the garden pond, and even in the pool. Its versatility and ease of setup make it a wonderful addition to any part of our outdoor area. The fountain is lightweight and portable, allowing us to experiment with different placements effortlessly.**Eco-Friendly and Low Maintenance:**Being solar-powered, this fountain is an eco-friendly choice that aligns with our family's commitment to sustainability. Additionally, it's low maintenance, requiring only occasional cleaning to keep it in top condition.**Conclusion:**The Yzert Solar Fountain Full Glass Panel with 2200 Capacity Battery has truly enhanced our garden experience. It combines aesthetic appeal, functionality, and eco-friendliness in a way that delights both us and the wildlife. As a preppy mom who cherishes a well-kept garden, I highly recommend this solar fountain. It's a beautiful and practical addition that brings life and color to our outdoor space.",

    "reviewText": "This small solar water fountain is wonderful to watch (in full sun). Obviously, since it uses a solar cell for power more sun means better operation. Our fountain was sited in a small enclosure near the bird feeder. We loved it. Minimal assembly required when it arrives. We discovered that a little shade covers our fountain in the afternoon, and this causes it to \"pulse\" as it gains enough energy to run the pump and then soon uses that little energy it has collected and shuts down till it can accumulate more sun power. When in full sun, it is a delight.",

I wouldn't go to deep or the bubbles would barely blow. I would put it in a 10-15 gallon tank not a pond. I replaced this pump with one that burned out. The burned out pump I had running would churn the water as if it had undertow ripples. This pump barely moves the water with it's highest settings. I'm going to keep this pump because I like the fact it runs on solor, so far it comes on when the sun comes up and runs for a while after the sun goes down. For this reason and this reason only I'm going to keep this pump. Would I recommend this pump for a deep pond or tank no!. But if fishing and you want to keep the fish alive yes it would be great for that. Otherwise no, I don't recommend this pump for ponds and deep aquariums.",

I over-estimated the flow needed for my fountain, so although it works, it's really noisy without a speed control. Not the pump mind you, the water flow! The fountain is in a courtyard near my front door and I bought a 3000 GPH pump which is way overkill for this 2' wide fountain with a small vertical lift. The variable speed controller allows me to dial it down to a pleasing small flow, or all the way up to an impressive stream. It's only been there 5 days now, but it's on a switch that cycles on and off once a day, and works perfectly. I'm pleased with the price and the function.",

I'm using it as a coolant pump for a CNC router, and imagine that some people use it to cool their CPUs, so it's likely in their bedroom, so be aware. The video doesn't do it justice - that's as quiet as it gets. If I lower it to the bottom of the bucket it gets much louder. Will be contacting the seller to see if this is \"normal\", or if I got a dude.Edit: The manufacturer was initially very responsive, agreeing that it's loud, asked for pics, and asked me to check several things. I did, reporting back that water was squirting out the sides of the pump, and asked if that's normal, or is a gasket missing - they never responded. I asked again - and again, no reply. So... it's going back, and I though I have no proof, suspect that they're all like this, and have ordered a different brand.",

    "reviewText": "This fountain just keeps working! I’ve had it running continuously, 24 hours a day for over 2 years! It must however be cleaned occasionally and if it stops working it probably needs cleaning which is simple, pop the end off, remove the foam filter, wash out the entire unit, pop the end back on. I’ve cleaned mine a few times per year and it takes a couple minutes. I have it in a huge ceramic pot filled with large rocks which the birds love bathing in all day and at night it looks beautiful. Maybe it’s magic, but I honestly think it’s just a really great fountain that’s well made. FYI pump power is great, fountain level is adjustable height. Zero noise except the wonderful sound of a waterfall. There is no battery, it’s electric. The cord is long, but my outlet was far away so I use an outdoor extension cord and I control the fountain with Alexa.",

    "reviewText": "I bought the upgraded solar fountain with rechargeable battery back up. It took a few days for it to be consistent with cloudy skies or sun down. The 16.5ft long cord from the pump to panel is a great for our greenhouse patio where sun is not consistent. Just move from one end to the other where the sun gets blocked from the building shadow. It comes with a stake and the panel angle is adjustable. Easy to put together and came with multiple sprinkle or spouting disc's to change up the spray.The in sun water spray height is very nice. As the skies get cloudy and sun goes down, it does reduce the spray power but keeps going at about half height ( pic #2 is cloudy most of day taken after 6pm).So far, it does not run through the night yet it runs longer than any without the battery. It helps prevent standing water bug issues and adds a nice soft water feature noise to the area.Have had this a week and am very happy I went with the upgraded model. Perfect addition for a wide galvanized wash tub pond I am growing mini water locusts in.We love utilizing solar lights and to find a small solar water pump for the mini pond feature that works this well, deserves a rave posting. Great value and quality for the money.Yes, I do wish it would continue through the night for those weekend gatherings. But for the price, the quality exceeds what we expected. We are ordering one for my mom so she can have a little pond water feature on her balcony with her plants and not worry about power cords.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Pump died within two months",
    "reviewText": "Update: lowered to one start as the pump died after about eight weeks.First the good: This is an excellent pump with good power - if anything the head pressure is a bit too much (see \"flaws\" below). The cord is high quality and long enough to place the solar panel in a sunny spot. The panel and battery work very well with a steady flow even on a cloudy day. I really appreciated the water level sensor that keeps the pump from running dry - these pumps usually end up draining a smaller bird bath as the wind blows the spray out of the bowl. When this happens the pump will be protected.The flaws, and there are a few: The pump is too strong and the spray will end up landing outside smaller bird bath bowls. An adjustable flow rate would have been appreciated at this price. The pump doesn't work well in deeper (two inch) bowls. The spray head ends up below the surface of the water and the spray pattern doesn't break the surface well. Including a simple extension piece, as many solar bird bath fountains do, would have helped significantly. Without an extension, six of the seven spray heads are worthless in a moderately filled bowl. On the plus side, this uses the same pump riser diameter as most other solar fountains so I was able to borrow a piece from a previous pump. The biggest flaw, and it's a show-stopper, is that the water filter holder is poorly designed. The pump has a small square of filter material keeping plant debris from being sucked into the impeller - this is a good idea for an outdoor pump. Unfortunately the holder for the filter block is open at the top. Either the filter floats out when the pump is off or a curious bird steals the block - either way the pump quickly becomes blocked without a filter. Fortunately the package includes extra filters but after losing two filters in two days, I had to fashion a wire cage around the filter holder to keep from losing the filter. Designing the filter holder to properly retain the filter could have solved this issue but instead the customer will have to devote time finding a way to keep the filter in place. This is very disappointing for a pump in this price range.",

    "reviewText": "Update 7/3: Because the lowest water flow is still too high, I put it under an Orchid pot. The lights shine real nice still above and throu6the pot holes. Pic Included.UPDATE 5/13: This sucker is packed with water flow power. Which is good, but even at the lowest setting it's too high. Even with a \"sock\" in it.:-) Stuffed some duct taped balled up under the sprinkler head and managed to slow it down. Very small. yet full of energy.*****OLD REVIEW: Powerful pump. Too powerful cause it shoots water up to the sky pond the lowest height setting. Only the sideways sprinkle works at a decent height. Lights nothing to write home about, but works decent as it is a plug in. Solar pumps are useless and they fail after the first year. I use it for a hummingbird sprinkler. Any advice on how to lower the pump pressure more? Too high on the lowest setting.",

Pump works well with nice flow if exposed in direct sun but also when in the shadow, as far as it has been exposed to sunlight enough to charge the back up battery. Wire is quite long for product of this price range and the filter in the pump to prevent early clogging is a good addition. Decent manual instruction, long time I don’t see this in a product made in China!I definetely reccomend.",

It's not bad but ild give 5 stars if it lasted longer. On the plus side, its rechargeable. The charge time does seem to take a long time vs the run time.",

    "reviewText": "I've been pumping water almost every day for almost 3 weeks to fill a trough for cattle from an old and shallow hand dug well. My original wiring dropped the voltage too much and did not work well. I rewired the pump directly to the 100W panel through a heavy duty battery switch, a heavy duty outdoor J box, SAE connectors with 10 ga pigtails and now as long as the sun is shining it works very well, not so well when it's cloudy. I'm satisfied for now. This beats the alternative, a gas powered trash pump. Next steps are battery and controller, maybe another panel, and automation.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Requires Wiring, Frustrating But Got It Figured Out in The End",
    "reviewText": "Im updating a fairly negative review I previously left. Although it's definitely not ideal that blunt end wires have to be connected and it would be helpful to have a manual showing how all the parts go together, the owner of the Amazon store contacted me directly after some not super productive correspondences with Amazon chat and provided clear answers that showed a strong understanding of my question and the product along with offering a substantial (and id say generous) partial refund on the product. Id stand by my initial complaints about it the kit requiring wiring and not having good instructions for combining the separate parts, but in the end I did receive good customer service and the issue resolved.Initial Experience:I don't know if the system works. If you order this you will receive a solar panel, some additional wires, and a pump with their own manuals but no instructions on how to combine them.To connect the solar panel and pump directly requires connecting two blunt end wires which isn't a trivial task, although I'm sure it's super simple to people more experienced in this. Not only do additional connectors need to be bought, but when I've contacted customer service several times to have them recommend a connector or further guidance on how to connect the blunt end wires they just send me back a diagram showing that black goes to black and red goes to red, which is already on the listing, and doesn't help actually physically making the connection.Additionally, the pump came with a manual saying that intricate prep like greasing and pulling back the wire coverings was required for the pump or the warranty would be voided, but that had appeared to already be done for my pump (as confirmed by the company) but is another example of the materials poorly matching the instructions.I hope to get this working with only $15 or so in extra parts. After about 6 back and forth a with their customer service, I'm largely giving up on them and trying to make it work with friends with more electrical experience.",

    "reviewText": "I will update with pictures if I can later on.I'm in eastern Washington state and needed to pump water with a *surface pump* from the little creek up to where my cabin is for gardening and showering purposes.I used one unit to pump water up the hill for 600 ft and 180 ft elevation where I placed a 275 gallon tank for collection purposes. Then I used another unit to pump that water for another 500 ft and elevation of 150 ft into another tank. Both systems works as intended overall and I'm happy with this product.A regular well would cost 500 times more at my elevation (I was quoted by a drilling company) and I was able to do what I needed (to water, take showers and even a little summer pool) at just a fraction of the cost.This season is over so I'm putting my pumps away and will update how well they work next season.So far I'm happy with the purchase and rate it 10/10. Will update later if something breaks next season etcMake sure you do research before buying to see if this is the right fit for you. You may have to accumulate water to wherever you're pumping to, because the pump doesn't pump continuously and is sun depended and wouldn't work at night. But in a sunny day I was able to pump all the way up to where my cabin is at 330 ft from the creek around 250 gallons.",

Want to yank it out of the ground and send the thing back but way to much to do that. I just want the damn thing to work as promised.

    "reviewText": "I am thus far (2 weeks in) pleasantly surprised. The solar pump works quite well. The solar panel seems to work even not pointed directly at the sun and and under passing clouds.The battery will run the unit after sun down, maybe 2 hours. However, I unplug the connection between the solar panel and pump once the sun no longer hits the panel. My reason is, the worst thing you can do to a lithium battery is to run it down to zero charge every day. That will certainly shorten battery life. In the morning, I don't plug the pump in right away. I assume/hope this allows the morning sun to charge up the battery and keep it from running down. For me, the battery's main use is to keep the pump running on heavily overcast days. For this reason, I wish there were an on/off switch so I wouldn't have to unscrew and unplug the connection, but I realize that most users are not going to unplug the pump to keep the battery in top health.Frankly, this is a 5 star review based on 2 weeks of ownership. I took off one star because other reviews indicate these things tend to have a high failure rate and short lifespan. I am relatively surprised that it has worked so well, but not holding my breath until it fails. Also, the pump is not terribly powerful. It is suitable for a large birdbath or a very small pond, like less than 50 gallons. Finally, there are others much cheaper with the same/similar pump and panel that have no battery. At $26, your paying a lot more for the battery, which is not necessarily a critical component in many applications. But if you want a small, solar pump with a backup battery, buy one.",

    "reviewText": "I have the Aquascape aeration kit that originally came with 2 for these aeration stones, and use it on small outdoor Koi pond in my backyard. I feel much better having extra air from these going into the water for when my pump and waterfall gets clogged up and slows to a trickle if not completely blocked. So this help give them backup oxygen, and for more energy on other days. Raccoons punctured my air lines so I had to pull my existing ones out, and while out, my dog got to one of the pond stones and chewed the connection off. So I am glad to see I can get an exact like kind replacement aeration disc easily. I can say it looks and works the same as a new disc that came with the kit at the beginning.My only gripe with these isn't about the replacement, but just what bugged me about the original disc. I have a hard time getting it to sink to the bottom of my pond. Sometimes it floats to the top. I had taken to tying rocks to it with twine to help hold it down. I think you have to remember to soak it in water before connecting it for hours first for it to work correctly.While replacing, it would have been nice if it came with some original tubing too. But I actually really like my thicker replacement tubing. However note that although the replacement tubing connected great to the aeration stone itself, I had to use some tape on the other end by the flow direction piece near the air pump, but would probably connect better directly to the pump. I found this to be compatible with 5/16 in OD / 3/16 in ID 20 foot line that worked great for this and much more durable.",

The installation was a breeze, and the 6.1ft power cord gave me plenty of flexibility to position the pump.One of the standout features is how incredibly quiet this pump is. Even though it’s powerful, pumping at 200GPH, you can hardly hear it running—just the soothing sound of the water flowing through the fountain. I also appreciate the adjustable flow control, which allows me to customize the water flow to suit my fountain’s design perfectly.The build quality feels solid, and with its dry-burning protection, I’m confident this pump will last a long time. It’s been a great addition to my courtyard, keeping the water moving smoothly and quietly. If you need a reliable and flexible pump for your fountain or other water features, this one is worth considering.",

    "reviewText": "I was given a small birdbath fountain this year, which needed a new pump. I picked this one because of the \"dry burning protection\" plus the good price. I used it June through mid-October, and it worked great! Even when the fountain got low on water several times during the heat of summer. It just needed a cleaning out a few times...I didn't take it apart all summer, just wiped off the intake port and it worked fine. I did clean it more thoroughly when storing for winter.It's got pretty good power! The fountain spray (through a small hose) shot up as much as 6 inches. Should work next summer too.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Very Compact",
    "reviewText": "I bought the small unit as a larger one I had ordered (same mfr) hadn't shipped after a week and Amazon couldn't tell me with any certainty when it would arrive. I had to cancel that one and get one that promised two day arrival. My rating is with the understanding the pump has only been running for a week now. So I am really not addressing longevity. I am using the pump in an outdoor fountain and for that I would say it is undersized. The description says it can pump to six feet and includes a fountain as a use. My 3 level fountain is maybe four feet high (and not that big) yet at full open it works but not much \"oomph\" coming out of the top, and this is brand new with no debris or hard water buildup impacting performance. I wouldn't go any less than something in the 400-600 GPM for an outdoor fountain if I had to do it all over again. An aquarium should be no problem. Also, pay close attention to the two connections that come with it. They are very small and if you are trying to connect to a threaded hard plastic pipe to move the water up to the top of the fountain, you are likely to have connection issues. The bigger pumps generally come with more connection adapters. This one is more suitable to plastic tubing. Other than that, size is nice and compact and it is easy to install and is quiet. I actually bought this brand for the dry burning protection. Only time will tell on that feature. So just pay more attention to the description and measurements than I did to make sure it will meet all of your needs.",

    "reviewText": "The velvet material is amazing. It feels so soft and smooth, The fabric is also skin-friendly and breathable. Even though it’s super soft, it’s not heavy at all. I used to think velvet might be too warm, but It’s the perfect balance of warmth and lightweight comfort. I love running my hands over the quilt because the texture is so luxurious. I didn’t expect it to feel this fancy, but now I never want to go back to regular quilts.One of the best things about this quilt is that it works all year round. It keeps me cozy but not too hot. When it gets really cold in the winter, I just layer it with a thicker comforter, and it adds the perfect amount of warmth without feeling bulky.I’ve also used it during cooler summer nights, and it feels so nice against my skin. Since it’s breathable, it doesn’t trap heat.The design of the quilt is another reason why I’m in love with it. It has a beautiful cross-stitched pattern and subtle striped details that make it look so classy. The color is perfect for my room because it goes with everything and gives off a cozy vibe. The design isn’t just pretty—it also feels durable. The stitching is really high-quality, so I’m confident it’ll hold up even after a lot of use. It fits my bed perfectly. The quilt is large enough to cover the sides of the bed nicely, and the pillow shams are the perfect size for my pillows. It makes my bed look neat and put together.",

    "reviewText": "I got this quilt to replace another light weight one, with the only issue being color. The other one is a mint green, and I am neither a fan of pastels, nor mint green. I’d been hoping for a more sage color when I bought it, but alas, the color gods weren’t with me on that one.This one came to my attention, being of similar weight, tho a bit heavier, and a very different green. Took a chance, and am very glad I did. The color of the green 2 one is very like what you see in the product page. It’s a medium green, very nice, not anywhere near pastel land.The velvet makes it somewhat warmer than my other quilt, which had a regular fabric finish. That’s fine with me. I am one of those people who overheats way too easily, and I prefer a cool bedroom (ceiling fan on at night all year around). This quilt is just fine for me, quite comfortable in terms of warmth.I don’t use pillow shams, so no opinion on those, tho they look quite nice.The reason for the star deduction is some curious spotting on the velvet. I’m taking into account that the diamond pattern of the fabric reflects light in different shades, but after carefully washing according to product directions, it has these spots of darker color spread throughout the surface. The first picture shows it the best, to my eye, but the color differentiation is more widespread in the second picture. Not sure how well this will come thru in my pics, but the first one with the smaller spot seems more clear to me.Due to the manner in which the diamond pattern reflects light with natural variations from shadows and such, these spots aren’t terribly noticeable, yet they’re there, for no reason that I can think of.It’s a nice quilt, and the velvet is very soft. I like it and will keep it. But…those darn spots!",

    "reviewText": "I ordered the green. Read the reviews about it being lighter than expected...yes, it is lighter - a soft silver-sage color (not too blue like teal/not too yellow like olive). I will be keeping as it works for my needs. I am concerned about the fold creases throughout. I washed it in cold and dried it in a cool dryer but they'er still there. I'm giving it time and then might try washing warm/drying hotter but I don't think it should be ironed (?). Quality it good though with a medium weight - more bedspread weight than light comforter weight/thickness",

    "reviewText": "I really love this quilt! The velvet is so soft and adds just the right amount of warmth for cooler nights, and the underside is comfortable and breathable against the skin if you're someone who doesn't use a flat sheet. The sizing is more generous than most of our other quilts (Queen size fits our mattress with well over 1ft hanging over all sides), which is great if your spouse tends to roll over and try to take the blanket with them like mine does, lol. It's not bulky at all and fits in our home washing machine so I don't have to go to a laundromat to use an XL washing machine when it needs to be laundered. Also, if you have pets like we do it's worth noting that it does not attract pet hair and doesn't snag on claws. I have zero complaints and love everything about this quilt set!",

Its breathable yet warm. We have a sheet, a thin blanket, and then this quilt is our top layer. We both feel that it is the perfect temperature and that rarely happens! Typically one person throws off a layer or two because were too hot but not with this!! Considering other colors to be able to change it up with the seasons!",

    "reviewText": "I got the F/Q mocha brown and was hesitant on 3 fronts - the size (thought maybe since it was touted as F/Q it would be smallish) , the color and how it would hold up after wash. No problems at all! The size is very generous. Doesn’t hit the ground but covers the thick mattress and over hangs nicely. And it feels so soft! The color was exactly as shown, not really the mocha brown I'm familiar w but it is absolutely in the same color-hue family and matches great tying the browns & grays in my bedroom together. Washes fabulous too, no issues. For the price you can’t go wrong. Actually, I put this in one of the top ten in Amazon purchases I’ve made! Very happy.",

The color is exactly as pictured, a gorgeous burnt orange copper that brings a wonderful rustic yet elegant vibe to our cabin.It’s super soft, lightweight, and cozy, making it perfect for year-round use. It’ll be ideal for summer, and in winter, we’ll just add a throw blanket for extra warmth. Highly recommend this blanket for anyone looking to add a cozy, stylish touch to their space! Five stars.",

A nice quilted design and velvety texture adds to the look. All the seams and stitching look good with no loose threads or broken seams. It’s not super thick or heavy but I didn’t expect it to be. If more warmth is needed simply add another layer underneath. So far I’d say very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend to someone looking",

    "reviewText": "The charging case lid had broken notches, the charging case smells burnt, and the earbuds produce no sound.I bought these Lilo and Stitch Bluetooth headphones with great excitement, as they were a special gift for my daughter, who is a big fan of the movie. However, the experience was completely disappointing from the moment I opened the package. When I took them out, I noticed that the box was broken and visibly damaged, as if it had suffered several impacts during shipping. Not only was it deformed, but it also looked like it had been handled carelessly.The product’s presentation is an important part, especially when it’s a gift, and this damaged box completely took away the charm. I couldn’t even give it to my daughter with the excitement I had hoped for. I also had to spend time looking for a last-minute alternative so she wouldn’t be disappointed. I believe that a product aimed at children and presented as an \"ideal gift\" should have better protection to avoid these kinds of issues.Please consider improving the packaging or taking additional precautions in shipping. I would not recommend this product if you plan to give it as a gift; the risk of receiving it in poor condition is very high and ends up ruining the experience.",

The right side is very low, I’ve cleaned it but it was rarely used because she used one side only. The left is not going on, doesn’t indicate if it’s charging and no sound is coming out. I’ve watched the video for troubleshooting but nothing complies to our situation. I know It’s been a long time but Im trying to connected to the company but there is no site to help. I just want to know what I can do to fix the problem. If they only last this long then that would really suck.",

I received this and am so impressed, considering the price for the 3 pieces! I used the smallest one on a short weekend trip and it was perfect! Very light weight and sturdy. I will use the larger ones for an overseas trip in a few months. I did not have any issues (so far) with the zippers as mentioned in some reviews. I love the color and ease of the wheels and turning. So pleased and would recommend to others!",

The inside liner broke on two of the three luggages. On the big luggage the wheel busted while it was being unloaded out of the van. When my son pulled it out and it hit the ground the wheel busted off. The screws pulled through the plastic. I wasn't out there so I don't know how bad it it the ground.

    "reviewText": "I bought this 3 piece to go on a cruise from NY to Miami and while packing the night before, the handle broke off with the allowed 50lb weight. It was too late to return so I travelled the next day hoping that it would at least hold up for the entirety of the flight and cruise. Arrived at JFK and the side handle broke off also. Got to Miami the next day and the largest suitcase was scratched up and extremely dented in like it was made of plastic. On my flight back to NY, the only thing that held up was the zipper. There is absolutely nothing to salvage. The suitcase is banged in on all sides, the top and side handles were gone before the suitcase ever got on a plane. I would now have to purchase another suitcase. The carry on held up nicely though. I'm guessing it's because I carried it onto the planes. If you're a frequent traveler like me, it's not going to work and you will be pissed and disappointed like I was. Don't waste your money and save yourself the anxiety of having to wonder and worry if you'll be humiliated with an open suitcase at the baggage claim carousel.Ps, there are no extenders on any of them. The best thing was the pretty colors but don't let that fool you. The handle is also flimsy. It felt like it was going to break off at any given time but surprisingly after experiencing all of the above, it did roll well.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this 3 piece to go on a cruise from NY to Miami and while packing the night before, the handle broke off with the allowed 50lb weight. It was too late to return so I travelled the next day hoping that it would at least hold up for the entirety of the flight and cruise. Arrived at JFK and the side handle broke off also. Got to Miami the next day and the largest suitcase was scratched up and extremely dented in like it was made of plastic. On my flight back to NY, the only thing that held up was the zipper. There is absolutely nothing to salvage. The suitcase is banged in on all sides, the top and side handles were gone before the suitcase ever got on a plane. I would now have to purchase another suitcase. The carry on held up nicely though. I'm guessing it's because I carried it onto the planes. If you're a frequent traveler like me, it's not going to work and you will be pissed and disappointed like I was. Don't waste your money and save yourself the anxiety of having to wonder and worry if you'll be humiliated with an open suitcase at the baggage claim carousel.Ps, there are no extenders on any of them. The best thing was the pretty colors but don't let that fool you. The handle is also flimsy. It felt like it was going to break off at any given time but surprisingly after experiencing all of the above, it did roll well.",

We had to walk with them for hrs. Waiting for our Airbnb and the streets were uneven and the tires sure make it , they got thrown out In The airport and no damage was visible.

I will use the larger ones for an overseas trip in a few months. I did not have any issues (so far) with the zippers as mentioned in some reviews. I love the color and ease of the wheels and turning. So pleased and would recommend to others!",

The inside liner broke on two of the three luggages. On the big luggage the wheel busted while it was being unloaded out of the van. When my son pulled it out and it hit the ground the wheel busted off. The screws pulled through the plastic. I wasn't out there so I don't know how bad it it the ground.

The toiletries bag is a little weird and honestly it doesn't do anything that the bags you already have don't, but for $100 for all 4 things I'd count it as a free gift. I would've preferred the personal item to have some pockets inside but I can live without them.I found it hard to move on 4 wheels when it was full but that could also be user error. It moved fine on 2 (tilted, pulling it behind me). The expander worked perfectly and the organization inside the hard suitcases was as expected, nothing special. There was a bit of scratching/denting on the checked bag but nothing to damage my things inside, but again, can't beat it for the price.If you're looking for super cheap luggage that still gets the job done fine, this is it.",

    "reviewText": "So let me tell you about my briefcase expirience with this specific briefcase. So I like to enjoy the finer things in life and look at the glass half full kinda person. So let me start with the positives the briefcase is super cute and stylish. I like that they look good. The storage capacity is amazing you could honestly pack up a water buffalo and take it home. The storage and looks are great couldn’t ask for better. So now that you made it this far here comes the drama and the bad that you all have been waiting for. The wheels on this thing suck I have made an appointment with my chiropractor because I’ve had to drag this thing across the country literally. The wheels would be better off if they were square. The wheels on this thing was probably molded by a blind Chinese kid they felt oval. While my back is shot from lugging this thing from on and off the plane to a cruise ship my mental state is also shot. I called my therapist to up my Zoloft prescription because it’s been so frustrating dealing with briefcase. If I had spare money I would do us all a favor and throw it off the cruise ship. The wheels are so terrible they would probably work better in the ocean where this thing belongs. So now the bright side if you want to become a strong man and participate in the worlds strongest man competition this bag is for you. Because like anyone else my wife and I pack everything but the kitchen sink and when we are on vacation probably by half of the Bahamas. Thank you for making me stronger cause I carried this darn thing literally everywhere because you couldn’t figure out how to make a wheel. You made a oval. Thanks for making me stronger,blowing my back out, and on the verge of a mental breakdown.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars I put this [brand new] to the 38,000 km test [24,000 mi], and found it somewhat wanting.",
    "reviewText": "Five weeks, 11 time zones, 33,000 km by air, and 5,000 km driving overseas. <23 kg and <7 kg [for those who know the drill], but never needed to open the \"expansion zippers\" on either hard bag. Bought a *second* set for my 13 yo daughter, so this review reports on BOTH sets, which had similar problems.a) Nearly every screw on the extendable dragging / pushing handles came loose, the first one by the third airport. We scrounged a tiny screwdriver and kept resetting the things, but had not my farm-girl noticed the problem and fixed it temporarily with the nail-file on my toe-nail clippers, it would have been a huge PITA. Now home, we will reset all of them with Loctite. Too expensive for the Chinese manufacturers, apparently.b) Nearly every internal zipper failed, on all four \"hard-case\" pieces, and the only zippers on two of the four (much smaller) soft-case pieces. They split apart, jammed, and were generally uncooperative on a consistent basis. Inexcusable, since an extra 10 cents per zipper probably would have taken care of the sucky-quality problem.c) The fabric for the zip-close sections of the \"hard case\" luggage ripped in a couple of places. Annayance, not problem, but SHEESH, people, this is not high-dollar stuff I'm asking you to fix.d) The \"hard case\" is not as \"hard\" as suggested. I had one \"casualty\" even though well-packed and set to contain any mess.We'll keep using this luggage, since it's basiclly decent, but if you're a serious traveller -- like 150,000 or even 100,000 ... go up a notch for quality.",

The backpack is well made and has enough pockets to hold all the things. Also has a spot you can put a phone charger and a slot for the wire to come out so you can use it while it’s plugged in. The smaller travel tote is roomy enough to hold quite a bit. I also get compliments every time I travel. Side note, I have seen a few people with the same set. So if you care that other people have the same set as you… then this might not be a good fit. ;)",

Bought a 3 piece clear cover set from Amazon as well and took luggage on 1st international flight.✈️ 28in had to go through a lot. There was a layover going and returning plus several times thrown in a bus or truck to a train to mini vans. Amsterdam, Belgium, Paris & London 10 day trip and this luggage still looks great! I see a few knicks but they're not noticeable. The cover took most damage but even the 28in cover can be used again. One small tear in it. No issues with zippers. It has pouches and bands inside and rolls nicely. My sister was jealous and wants a set too. I do recommend this luggage!❤️",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Showkoo luggage Set, and overall, I must say I'm quite pleased with my purchase. The set offers ample space, comfortable handling, and a sleek design that makes it stand out on the baggage carousel. However, I did encounter an issue with the larger piece's retractable handle mechanism, which detracted slightly from an otherwise positive experience.Let's start with the positives. The luggage set boasts generous storage capacity, allowing me to pack all my essentials and more without feeling cramped or constrained. The internal compartments and pockets help keep belongings organized and easily accessible, which is a definite plus during hectic travel days.Moreover, the luggage is surprisingly comfortable to maneuver, thanks to its smooth-rolling wheels and ergonomic handle. Even when fully loaded, I found it effortless to navigate through crowded airports and busy streets without feeling fatigued or strained.The durability of the material also impressed me. Despite being subjected to the rigors of travel, the luggage held up admirably, showing minimal signs of wear and tear. This bodes well for longevity and speaks to the quality craftsmanship that went into its construction.However, the standout feature that sets this luggage apart is its spaciousness. Whether for a weekend getaway or an extended vacation, I never found myself wanting for extra room. The ability to expand the suitcase for additional storage is a game-changer, accommodating last-minute souvenirs or unexpected purchases with ease.Unfortunately, my experience was marred by a notable issue with the retractable handle mechanism on the larger piece. During my last trip, I encountered difficulty retracting the handle, which became stuck in the upright position. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue, I ultimately had to force it down to check it in, which was inconvenient and concerning.While this hiccup was frustrating, it didn't overshadow the overall positive impression I have of the Showkoo luggage Set. Its comfort, spaciousness, and durability make it a solid choice for frequent travelers like myself. However, I hope the manufacturer addresses the retractable handle issue to ensure a seamless experience for future customers.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars So far, really nice!",
    "reviewText": "Tired of inline-skate type wheels and ducted-taped corners of my old soft-sided luggage, I purchased this set for my upcoming month-long cruise. So far, I'm really impressed! Transitioning from soft-sided to hard-sided might take a moment (opening like a book instead of a box), but I think I'll really like it. The 28\" and 26\" can both expand, which is a necessity for this habitual over-packer! The zipper on the 26\" case had two places where the teeth of the zipper has pulled apart, but in running the zipper over them they closed up fine. I am watching them very closely though and will replace that case if they cause any further trouble. (I purchased the 3 year coverage.) The corner of the 28\" case has two small areas of discoloration (like the plastic had been stressed), but there is no damage to the case otherwise, so I'm not concerned about that. The TSA locks were easy to change the passcode. The zippers don't fit as deep down into the locks as I expected, but they locked fine. The locking mechanism doesn't appear to be the best though -- somewhat small and flimsy. A couple bad hits or bumps, and they'll probably not work. Makes me glad I purchased the coverage! However, the zippers do have holes to put a padlock type lock through if they do fail. The lock on the 26\" case got caught and wouldn't open at first. I gently manipulated the lock until it finally released and opened. I'm hoping that it was a sticky place due to newness and not being used. However, it that happens again, I will request a replacement case. The material inside the cases is so nice! It is not plastic like in less expensive types of luggage. The interior zippers do seem a little thin for my taste, but they work very well so far. Each case has three interior pockets, the dividing sheet which zips closed on the left side, and an x-type elastic band to hold clothing in place on the right side. The wheels work well, but I hope they are attached very well to the cases (you can't tell how they're attached). The telescoping handles seem par for the course. I love the soft feel of the handles on each of the cases (one on top, one on the side), and they go flat so they shouldn't catch on anything in transit. The thin rubber along the edges of the cases where the zippers are don't seem to be very sturdy. I think the rubber stripping should be a bit thicker and sewn on with at least a double stitch. As they are, there's only one line of stitching attaching the rubber to the case. This is definitely something I'll keep my eye one.Once I use this luggage set, if my opinion changes or if anything goes wrong, I will update this review by Dec of 24. I gave four stars rather than five for the concerns mentioned previously. However, so far I am very pleased with theses cases.I would recommend purchasing.",

La maleta grande hice un viaje de León- México- Amsterdam- Tel-Aviv. salí con 25 kgs y regresé con 29kgs sin problema alguna, rodó muy bien en los aeropuertos con el peso y todo se ve bien. Los rayones son de esperarse, aunque en realidad no la veo muy dañada. Espero cuando menos 2 años de uso en la pequeña y con las otras no las uso tanto, mi esposa compró una Samsonite Mediana, será punto de comparación. Contento con la compra.",

    "reviewText": "I bought the 5 piece set in 2021 before I moved to Wales. I moved all my belongings over in it. The two smaller bags are not very useful, I use a backpack instead of the tote and lost the little travel bag. The three rolling bags however are amazing. A little over 3 years later the two bigger ones are still being used. I personally broke the 20\" carry on by overfilling it (cramming in my neck pillow). This broke the plastic shell, which I then proceeded to tape with Gorilla tape and some stickers and keep using for another year and a half before I bought a new one in a new colour. My mom has since claimed the mildly broken one and is using it.These bags have moved my belongings from USA to Wales, then to Scotland, and then to Slovakia. I use them now every time I travel back to the states or splurge for a an extra bag on a Ryanair flight. I absolutely love them, great value for money. I don't know what people are doing to break them so easily, other than some scuff marks they are doing really well.I will say the blue colour I got is very popular amongst luggage, it doesn't stand out very well.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy, cute, expandable, & cheap; but inspect it upon arrival",
    "reviewText": "I originally bought two of these for my kids. They are sturdy and the colors are super cute. Perfect size for carry on, even when expanded. And the wheels expand with it, so it does not fall to one side when expanded (like my old luggage). I particularly appreciate that the wheel base expands when the luggage is expanded. The extendable side is under the zipped lining, so it keeps the clothes in.I find the elastic band with the buckle a bit too stretchy and it does not really hold the items in place when opening the luggage, but just being careful to open the luggage with that side down does the trick to keep everything in place. I also put the larger items on that side and placed a large towel on top to ensure everything on that side stayed in regardless. It’s a bit of a hazle, but can’t complain considering I paid about $35 for this luggage.I like the squareness of the design: it fits a lot of clothes and shoes easily and is spacious inside. The handle rails do not take a lot of space internally, so it’s easy to pack items without them interfering too much (another challenge I had with my old luggage).The hard side kept everything protected and did not get stained even after having to check the bags gate-side and pickup at baggage claim. I think the fact that the luggage was comfortably full helped, but I was pleasantly surprised that the hard case was not stained, dirty, cracked, or damaged after that.I love the colors! So I ordered 3 of these. The last one came with a torn stitch which caused the lining and stretch buckle to be loose on one side (see pictures). Thankfully, I was going to use it right away, so I unboxed it right away. Too bad that this caused me to have to travel with my old luggage (which is having trouble with the handle retracting.). But, I was able to return it to Amazon, so no issues.overall, I’m really happy with this purchase, and my daughters love their luggage!One thing I noticed is that these hard case suitcases are not very forgiving when unevenly full and become really hard to zip, but moving things around inside did the trick. I was a bit apprehensive about packing too much in and whether the lining and sticking was going to hold, but was pleasantly surprised after our first international trip with these.The wheels and handles worked well and smoothly, making it easy to maneuver around the airport. I like the rubber pads on the side, which keep the luggage from cratching essily. Overall, great value for the money!",

    "reviewText": "My old luggage was looking worn and dirty. I didn't want to get rid of it because it was so lightweight. I took a chance and bought these (in blue). I was surprised to find that they were good quality, easy to maneuver with the 360 wheels, and lightweight! I paid over twice as much for luggage like this in the past. Another benefit is the built-in TSA approved lock on each piece. Very convenient! The inside is lined with a black material that's easy to wipe off in case of spills. The divider also has a zipper compartment for easy access to a tablet or notebook. The outside seems sturdy. I'll write another review after I use it this winter. I'm really happy I got this luggage and I would definitely recommend it.",

Hopefully will get a positive resolution!More than 30 days after purchase, I guess I don't travel enough. No return replace.Love the color! The cases seem very sturdy and are the perfect sizes. There is plenty of room to pack every thing you need for a week+ long vacation. These suitcases did very well on our first trip. Love the spinner wheels, made navigating easy. I was happy that I could wipe off all the grime after the trip and before storage. Would purchase again!",

    "reviewText": "I NEVER leave reviews but buyers need to look elsewhere for their luggage. I purchased this set at the end of 2023 as a Christmas gift for my son's fiancé, for their honeymoon in October of 2024. She has never traveled over seas and she was so excited for the new set as she did not have any luggage.The photos provided are not one corner, BUT 3 CORNERS. The first wheel broke as they got to the airport to leave on their FIRST flight. Meaning, it had never been used and it broke upon first use almost immediately. They persevered with the other wheels still in tact.FORTUNATELY- they went on a cruise so once aboard they did not have to use it again until departure.They are currently flying back over the Atlantic on their return home and the next 2 pictures are what happened on the first flight of their travel home. THEY ARE DOWN TO ONE WHEEL Y'ALL!!!!Obviously- I am just mortified that the first big gift I gave to her as a future family member was total crap and literally fell apart on them with only 2 uses.I am sure there is nothing the seller or Amazon will do since it has been so long since purchased so I just want other potential buyers to KEEP SCROLLING for another seller and different manufacturer so you are not gifting crappy luggage or even plan to use for yourself.If you made to the end... you a real one.",

    "reviewText": "Hey Amazon! I never received this nor was it ever shipped!!! You still have my money though and it is impossible to get help with this! I ordered, paid, and was eventually advised of a delay. Then no communication and items never shipped to me. When I circled back to see where my items are Amazon tells me too much time has passed. They won’t help me. No refund nor proof of shipping provided. I assure you they did not ship this to me! Nothing!!!! Yet they know they have my money! Oh and it is nearly impossible to reach Amazon!!!! Do not trust this business nor Amazon to care to do the right thing. Their reasoning is it’s my fault that I did not notify of their non shipment to me much earlier. I was out of the country for 3 months while this occurred. Not having a responsibility to fulfill orders is bogus and a bad business practice. They are still selling this set possibly by the 100’s daily yet they do not think they actually need to ship out what was paid for? I mistakenly assumed they would have good business practices. I now know that is a bad assumption on my part. I do not want this to happen to others. Consider this your warning. Oh and I have ordered many of these exact suitcases over the years for all of my family. They need to be replaced often because they crack and the wheels break easily and/or the lining tears. That said I have liked them due to how light weight they are. Don’t expect them to last more than a few trips. I consider them disposable luggage.",

    "reviewText": "Okay, so this is my first purchase of luggage. I've never really traveled or had need for luggage before, but I knew I wanted something that stood out against all the black, red, and purple luggage I saw the one and only time I flew. I scoured the internet for something bright but at least somewhat affordable and came across this set. I read the reviews and noticed they were a little back and forth but went ahead and risked it anyway. Here's what I thought.If you're looking for something that can be completely beat up while traveling without a single sign of tear and wear, then you probably don't want to order this luggage. However, if you take into consideration that you're getting a four piece set for $100 and that it's going to get beat up, it's not a bad deal. I used the largest suitcase to travel to Las Vegas from Detroit for my wedding. The luggage itself actually help up really well. I didn't have anything torn or anything like that. Only down side was now I realize why people get dark luggage. You can totally see everywhere my luggage touched on the conveyors and what not. It's pretty dirty looking, but it's just dirt.You can sort of tell the cheapness to the luggage when you open it, but honestly, for $100 for a four piece set, it was 100% worth it in my opinion. It protected my stuff and got it moved safely back and forth and that's all I needed it to do. Plus now I can use the smaller ones for traveling by car to see family. I would definitely recommend this to people who want something that isn't just the same boring suitcase everyone else has. However, for those of you who travel a TON by plane and need something that's going to really last you, I'm not sure how well this would work out. You just really have to remember you're getting what you pay for in a way.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Skeptical Based on Reviews, Impressed Upon Arrival!",
    "reviewText": "I had read all the reviews of this set after I ordered it. I ordered 2 of them, the Zebra print and the Camouflage print. I was becoming very nervous based on the reports of the seams and zippers being broken. However, when this set arrived I was very impressed. The only defect I noticed was minor fraying on the strap of the largest piece. I trimmed with scissors and now it looks perfect. I rolled them around the house and didn't see any issues with the wheels. I took out and tested each individual piece as this is a purchase for our upcoming trip in 2 weeks from AZ to TX and another trip at the end of July from AZ to NY. I packed the middle piece with my son's medical supplies weighing 40 pounds. It still rolled nicely after being packed. Also, I noticed on the other reviews that there were complaints about the luggage standing after being packed. I didn't have this problem, the luggage stood perfectly on both tile and carpet. I packed heavier items towards the wheels and the lighter items towards the top strap. The little tote bags that came with set are large compared to what I have seen. My son has played with his quite a bit in the last 24 hours. Opening and closing it and filling it to the top and emptying it. So far there haven't been any issues with a broken zipper or seam. Based on other items that I have seen in the stores, this is a great value. I have seen comparable items in the store for $99 for just the largest piece. I haven't yet put these through an airport test. As I stated we don't leave for 2 weeks. If I find that these pieces don't hold up, I will be sure to add an update.There are a few cons that I noticed. The locks that come with the set are cheap and chinsy. I would recommend buying separate locks if you need them. *****Major Con for Zebra set**** The coloring is definitely off. It is not a lime green outline. It is certainly more of a neon yellow. This didn't bother me as I will need something that sticks out at the airport. However, if you are someone that is looking to match something else with this set it will be difficult, if not impossible.Overall, I would say this is a great set for the price. If you are looking for something that is top of line, I wouldn't recommend this. However, if you are looking for something that is affordable and decent, I would highly recommend this set.",

I am currently using the carry on bag as my toiletry bag because I ordered a toiletry bag and it never showed up and the carry on works great as a toiletry bag. The lock is a joke I took them off and left them at my house it's like a child's diary play lock they don't weigh much at all. Now the cons. The handles that extend out seem week and flimsy like they will break any minute, the bags don't stand up well because how the wheels are and the zippers like to stick and when I got the luggage the zipper things were closed but the zippers teeth were separated (if that makes sense) all in all I am happy I got these when I did because if I got them a few days later I would have been pissed that I spent money on them. I bought these in desperation.",

    "reviewText": "I needed a carry-on bag, and this is a good size. It comes with the smaller travel bag, which I ended up not taking. The set is great. It's sturdy, it's light, and it fits in the overhead bin! I also chose this for the design, which is easy to spot at baggage claim. I wanted something durable to transport old family photos, and this was perfect. The size is great, too. I fit 3 pairs of jeans, a skirt, 2 dresses, 2 pairs of pajamas, about 6 shirts, 2 pairs of sandals, and plenty of underwear/bras. Amazing, right? I'm 67 and wondered if the design was a little juvenile for me. But I don't really care about that because it's pretty and perfect for the job. I did have a good chuckle when I saw a teenage girl at the airport with the same bag! Here I thought I'd never see another bag like mine; and it turns out there were two of us with the same good taste!",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Coolife Luggage 4 Piece Set Suitcase and I have been extremely impressed with its quality and functionality. This set comes with four different sizes of suitcases, making it perfect for any type of travel, whether it be a short weekend trip or a long vacation.One of the standout features of this luggage set is the TSA lock. This provides an added layer of security and peace of mind when traveling, as it allows only TSA agents to open and inspect your luggage without damaging the lock. This is especially useful for international travel where customs may need to inspect your bags.The suitcases are made of a softshell material, which not only makes them lightweight but also durable. I have used this set on multiple trips and have not experienced any tears or damage to the material. The spinner wheels also make it easy to maneuver the suitcases through busy airports and streets.The black and red color combination of this set is sleek and stylish, making it easy to spot on the baggage carousel. The interior of each suitcase is also well-designed with multiple compartments and pockets, allowing for efficient packing and organization.Overall, I highly recommend the Coolife Luggage 4 Piece Set Suitcase for anyone in need of a reliable and stylish luggage set. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, functionality, and customer service. I am confident that this set will last me for many more trips to come.",

    "reviewText": "Update on my previous Review -I would like to make an amendment to my previous review about my Coolife suit case. While I was disappointed about the large suit case collapsing during my first trip, which compromised the entire suit case. I contacted Coolife about my experience, and I was emailed back immediately by Blair. Blair took the time to look at the photos I sent, read my email to Coolife and read my review on Amazon. I was surprised at the amount of time she took to resolve my issue. I even received a personal phone call from Blair. During this phone conversation, she listened to my concerns about the suit case and why it was important that I have one that is very sturdy. She offered me two options for replacing the previous suit case. She sent the links directly to my email, so I could look at the links at my convenience. Once I had made a decision, I emailed her back and got another prompt email with details about the replacement suit case. Coolife sent me the replacement hard shell suit case at no charge. Even after I got my replacement suit case Blair called and sent me an email to touch base to ensure that everything with the new suit case was good.Blair provided exceptional customer service, and I was very happy that Coolife replaced my suit case with no charge. Even though my first suit case was compromised, I highly recommend Coolife due to the incredible customer service I received! A big Thanks to Blair for all her help! Based on this experience I will be changing my rating to 5 stars, great costumer service goes a long way.Previous review -I ordered this luggage because my old luggage had fallen apart. I was very excited to get this luggage because I had a number of trips coming up this summer. I read a number of reviews about how easy to move and durable this luggage set is. Durability is very important to me because I travel to a variety of places, everything from resorts for ballroom competition to remote places around the world. I am very disappointed that the largest suit case of the set did not even make it through my first flight. One side of the suit case a few inches above the wheel collapsed or the metal wire bent, but either way it compromised the entire suit case. It made it very difficult to wheel the suit case once I had arrived to my destination. Due to this, it made me very nervous when I was flying back because I did not know if it would hold up through my travels' home or not. Even though this was extremely disappointing because I was hoping this suit case would be as sturdy and long lasting as my previous large suit case, the carry on suit case was amazing and full filled all the expectations I had for it.I do want to note that the carry on suit case and the middle size (which I have not used for travel yet), and the large suit case arrived in good condition and as described by the seller.Due to my experience, I am going to rate this a 2 instead of a 1 because the large suit case was not durable enough to make it through my first flight, which made it difficult to move the suit case once I had arrived and during my travels back. The carry-on suit case held up wonderfully, which helped earn the additional star for this review.",

The damage was in the corner where the wheels are attached to the luggage. If there was reinforcement in that area, it may have lasted longer.All in all- this luggage has traveled a bit.

    "reviewText": "This is the first set of luggage that I've owned with a zipper instead of a hard-shell case with a snap-down latch. Thought I'd try it. There is definitely lots of space in these things and they roll SO SMOOTHLY!!! I gotta give them that. But the outer shell is quite flexible so there is the chance that more fragile packed things could get damaged if you don't pad them right, and none of the zippers seem very strong to me. I am planning to return to the clamp-style. No more zippered cases for me. The other thing is that these come with little combination luggage locks that are completely worthless!!!! Weak locks, not TSA-friendly, and they don't always set right when you try to change the combination. Worthless. Anyway, loved the colors and the great rolly-wheels... but that's about it. :)",

But recently the handle broke so I went shopping, when I say I went shopping, I pulled up Amazon😁😁. Luggage is so expensive, and I’m not giving upwards of $200 for a “carry on” so I went back to my old standby. I purchased this piece , It is by for not the most expensive, or probably not the best luggage, but if it lasts like my last one it is well worth the cost. It is easy to maneuver around, and comes with a small combination lock, if you chose to use it.",

    "reviewText": "We bought the 20\" version of this bag about 18 months ago and traveled with it multiple times since without a problem. Before traveling to Alaska for three weeks, we decided to replace our old 28\" bags with the 28\" version of this brand, since we liked the smaller version so much. We bought two sets and packed both to be well under the 50-lb limit set by the airlines. The wheel broke off my husband's bag as we wheeled it into the hotel on the first night of our trip. The first wheel on my 28\" bag broke off on the 10th day of our travels, and a second wheel on my 28\" bag was missing when we got to the airport for our final leg home. We left home with a total of 8 wheels between the two bags. We made it home with 5. Not great odds. I admit that we were on and off multiple planes, trains, and buses during our journey, but that's what travel often is and that's what your luggage is supposed to survive. According to the manufacturer, this luggage is, \"...made of ABS. The major benefits of this material - it is extremely lightweight, it is durable, and protects the contents of your luggage.\" I would suggest that unless you're packing to do a driving trip that doesn't involve anyone else handling your luggage, pick a different brand. Their five-year warranty doesn't cover \"damage by the common carrier\" making this stuff worthless for anyone traveling on commercial carriers...which is most of us.",

They held up well and were easy to open. I fit about four days' worth of clothes and shoes with the clothes rolled in the little bag. Glad to have them.",

The handle broke off one of them on the way to the car. I went to Walmart and bought two more suitcases for the trip. If the first one broke while carrying it empty I was not taking it through the airport and on a cruise. It could have been a one off issue but they did feel cheap.

We used the biggest one for a trip to San Antonio and the convenience of wheeling a suitcase on four wheels...HEAVEN. it is roomy, rolled very smoothly, is light weight, and of good quality. The wheels could be a bit sturdier but they maneuvered fabulously, turning without a hitch.It is true to colour so very pretty, and looks exactly as pictured.What I didn't like is that there is no lining in the cases and the wheels could be a little sturdier.They are a great value for the price and easy to use.I didn't give it 5 stars because of the absence of linings but overall I highly recommend!",

This was my first hard sided luggage set - I'm pretty happy with the quality... but I also ran to my nearest costco to compare the quality of a pricier set of luggage.Honestly, can't tell the difference.There are zippered \"pouches\" that are access panels to the screws holding up the wheels & the branding. The wheels seem to be user replaceable.The zippers were smooth & felt like decent quality.Casters rolled along my floor smoothly & were completely silent in operation.The TSA locks are also satisfying to lock/unlock. They snap into the side & pop out with a press of a button. If you forget your combination (which you can set yourself), you have the option of purchasing a separate TSA lock for the zippers too.For the price, this is tough to beat.No complaints here!5/5",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Poor quality",
    "reviewText": "The description states: “ Interior waterproof 210D Oxford fabric compartments help organize and keep your items seperate.” Well, the interior material looks and feels very cheap. On one bag the material detached from the zipper, while packing for a trip. On another bag, the zipper broke while closing the interior compartment.Worst of all, I purchased 4 sets of 3, as it is advertised. I received 1 set of 3, and 3 sets of 2.The 26 inch bags were not in the box. I have already contacted the seller and I am waiting for a reply.Update: I contacted seller on March 8th explaining the issue. I sent them the photo of the 30 inch bag with the broken zipper. I explained about the missing bags. Now, already March 13th and still seller has not provided a final solution. From the seller’s latest message, looks like the three 26 inch bags will be forever missing because on the 12th, seller said “We can only send you A replacement to solve this problem for the one with a broken zipper.” from that message looks like the problem of the three missing bags will not be solved.Well, if you buy this set for 79.99 you may or may not get the three bags described. I guess 79.99 for two bags is still a good price.",

    "reviewText": "This luggage set was perfect for my extended weekend trip. I did use a different smaller bag as my carry-on. The smaller size just did not hold enough for me. My husband had the same set in a different color and used both luggage pieces. I was able to fit everything I needed into the suitcase, and it does have an extender on it. , and it does have an extender on it. It was easy to lift and put in the overhead compartment. The handle was fine for me and I did not have trouble moving through the airport with the luggage. Quality is a thicker material. I did not have any anxiety of the suitcase falling apart. My only complaint was the suitcase would fall over easily. But I was able to manage quite well. The wheels moved easily, and there were only two on the bottom of the suitcase, but I did not have an issue with that. I loved the color options that were available with the suitcases. I highly recommend if you were looking for something not too expensive, but sturdy and going to Be strong and hold your belongings safely.",

    "reviewText": "This set was fantastic for my very first plane trip, but now I see why most people carry black luggage lol. I got the pink set and it's gorgeous. Received many compliments from others at the airport. However, when the flight is fully booked and this pink carry on has to be checked, it runs the risk of it being put facedown into a puddle of deisel fuel (which happened to me). So with hot water and Dawn, I washed and scrubbed as best I could. There is still a little bit of the dirt/grease mark still on it and the fabric glue has come off inside on the large front pocket because of my scrubbing, but it does not affect the integrity of the carry on. Nothing is ripped, the fabric on the pocket is justa little loose now when the bag is empty. Still fills out well! I'm still happy to use it! It just looks like I've travelled a lot lol ;-)",

I spent a lot of time searching online and reading reviews to find a good suitcases. And welllll I absolutely love these suitcases! So far I’m obsessed with the fact that 1. you can store them all together as one so it doesn’t take up a crap ton of space. 2. There is something to keep everything in place on both sides. 3. The wheels swivel. 4. The zippers are super easy to use, they don’t catch. 5. So far durable. (I accidentally dropped the small one of concrete from my trunk when I went on a small in state trip and not a single scratch or dent. I got a small smudge on it though but it wiped right off.) 6. There’s a lock on each suit case so TSA can’t get into your bags! 7. The bags are super light weight. And last but not least 8. I love the color and style of these suit cases. They are just so aesthetically pleasing. UPDATE: I took the large suitcase to Mexico and it did not break or have a single scratch on it! 10/10 recommend!",

And when packed, the big one can be quite heavy, the wheels make it a dream to move around. Not sure but I think fully packed, the bigger one might take you over the standard 23kg as it is quite heavy on its own. So, I’m going to be mindful of that. All round? Great value for money!",

The wheels rolled smoothly through airports and the streets of Tokyo. The handles moved easily and, due to the side handkes, I could lift the bags easily. Unfortunately I did not use the largest piece until the day I was leaving for latest trip and discovered the lock was broken and half detached from the suitcase. Luckily I had a separate TSA lock I could use. Make sure to check each piece when they arrive, even if you only use one of them.",

    "reviewText": "This luggage set is amazing. I’ve had it for about six months and I’ve traveled numerous times with all three sizes and I’ve never had any problems. No scuffs, no dents, no slices, and no cracks.My last luggage set was destroyed by the airline and I learned the hard way that you have to research what type of material your luggage is made by, otherwise, you may end up with your clothes coming down the conveyer belt at the airport. Well after that incident, I did my research and came across this luggage set. The price was great and I was excited to try it out.After months of both domestic and international travel, always checking my bag, and always having to pay the overweight fee because I’m not a light packer, these suitcases have held up incredibly well. The material is incredibly durable yet flexible so when your luggage is being thrown around, it can withstand the force without breaking, while still protecting your items inside.",

I have purchased 2 sets , one for me and my husband. Love the orange and the blue is very pretty. Still trying to get the protective plastic wrap off. We recently flew Spirit airlines and they are very strict with the size of luggage and the smallest of this set was perfect for that airline and still big enough for a few days away. So far great product and excellent price!",

    "reviewText": "I don't know yet how this luggage will hold up. So I can't review on that. However... be prepared to spend hours pulling off plastic film from EACH piece. There is nothing I hate more than wrapping gifts and this is as much a pain in the a@# as that! Out of control waste of plastic! Protective film? The minute this luggage leaves my sight there will be marks... so why is this necessary? And thank you for making me work and clean ( because it comes off in so many pieces and has static) just to use this luggage. Please do not read this wrong, I am grateful that I need luggage.. it's the amount of plastic for zero need that is maddening",

The built in locks are not TSA approved locks as advertised in the description. They do not contain the TSA approved logo/mark. The locks have no physical keyhole for a TSA lock key. No instructions were included on how to manage the lock (e.g. change the code). The hardware for the luggage is installed overtop the protective film on the case itself. It took me an hour to remove the film fully from all three bags. The abs plastic is thin ensuring limited durability. Spend a few extra dollars for something better. This item is being returned.",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Skeptical after just opening the box",
    "reviewText": "When I first opened the box, i noticed what appeared to be scuffs in the largest suitcase. Upon removing them from the packaging, I realized they had a \"protective film\" covering the suitcases. This immediately brought to mind the question \"if this is a durable finish why does it require a protective film?\" I began removing the film and encountered 2 primary issues. First, I have arthritis and chronic tendonitis in my hands, it has taken me almost an hour to get the majrity of the film off 3 suitcases. The film does NOT come off easily at all. Second, with out the use of something like a utility razor, there is NO way to get all the film removed (see pics). The film simply stretches and tears to shreds when you try to remove it from the edges and fasteners. I would prefer to not have to take a razor or knife to my brand new suitcase before I even have the chance to use them. So my brand new suitcase set looks quite ragged, as if the finish is peeling. Why, if a protective film was necessary for shipping, did the manufacturer not make certain the film was not trapped under every edge of every fitting to allow for full remaval. And if the manufacturer was confident in the durability of the finish, was a protective film necessary in the first place? Another concern is they feel rather cheap. There is a flimsiness to the structure and fittings that does not inspire confidence. Also, there are no included instructions on how to reset the lock codes from 0-0-0. My next step will be searching online to try and figure out how to reset the codes for some degree of security for my belongings.On a positve note, the color is lovely as is the current finish and design. The zippers, handles, and wheels all move easily. They are lightweight. And they were inexpensive.As a side note, I bought a simlar set of a different brand for my son at the same time I bought these for myself. The price of the other set was comparable. It felt much more durable and did not have a protective film. My suggestion to anyone looking to purchase a new suitcase set is keep looking. There are other sets in this price range without the hassles I have encountered simply removing these from the packaging.*I travel several times per year for work and pleasure. If I don't forget, I will update my review at a later date once I have put these to use a few times.",

I love that they all fit inside each other because it’s a great space saver when it comes to storing them. I like being able to lock the suitcases and that they expand. I had a little bit of trouble with the zipper at first but it didn’t feel cheap or breakable to me. Very spacious and I like that one side has a cover that zips close so my stuff doesn’t fall out when I open or close the suitcase. They’re a little hard to wheel if you’re an overpacker like me but I find that happens with most suitcases. Hopefully will last me for the upcoming years and perfect for short or long trips. I like how sleek the black looks and the matching set. Looking forward to seeing how long they last!",

    "reviewText": "I needed new luggage and didn’t want to spend an arm and a leg for luggage. I found this set and the reviews were ok enough to purchase. I was wrong. Every single size luggage has broken or had issues, the internal zipper compartment broke after 1-2 uses so I cannot zip my things into the compartment and every time I open the luggage it’s a mess. Each size has the same issue happen to it. Additionally the wheels do not work well whatsoever, it is extremely hard to wheel the luggage if you have anything remotely heavy in the suitcase. The padding pieces on the outside have also come off exposing the screws on the luggage. All in all I wish I spent a little more for a trusted brand luggage that wouldn’t have broken the first time or two I used it. I didn’t think it could make that big of a difference but boy was I wrong.",

I ended up using the largest bag and luckily it fit all of my stuff including shoes, clothes, towels, etc. When I received my luggage from the baggage claim, it was not dented, cracked, or damaged at all other than a small area of paint that came off near the bottom of the bag which did not bother me at all, as I don’t expect them to appear completely brand new forever. I more recently used the smallest bag for a weekend trip and it did not disappoint either, it has so much room for such a small bag, overall i would highly recommend this set to anyone looking for something affordable but reliable. I never ended up using the lock code feature on either of the bags yet, though I’m sure they wouldn’t cause any issues.",

    "reviewText": "UPDATED REVIEW: I traveled to CA and the luggage held up so well! I’m truly impressed. I haven’t even notice more damage than a couple very tiny scratches. I flew on a smaller plane, so overhead space was limited, but I easily carried my small suitcase on the plane and it wasn’t too heavy to put in the overhead bin. These sets are awesome!! Worth the splurge in my opinion.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this set because my older, soft-sided luggage was on its last leg from my latest trip. I love that this Betsey Johnson luggage has more than 2 wheels so it’s nice and easy to maneuver.I haven’t traveled with them yet-I’ll be using the carry on only for my CA trip in July, but I expect the carry on will hold up just fine.The one thing I’m concerned about, which others have mentioned, is that when/if any of the bags are checked, the TSA agents are very unforgiving, and the luggage may not hold up very well. This is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5.FedEx delivered the box to my front door which was so helpful because I live on the third floor of my apartment building. The luggage comes in a large Betsey Johnson box, so I imagine if you wanted to surprise someone with it, it may be difficult to hide what it is.I believe that unfortunately, there’s really no way to guarantee that you won’t receive a set with damage or defects... it’s kind of the luck of the draw. My set was perfect, but obviously there are reviews where that was definitely not the case.All in all, I might buy again , however Amazon raised the price from around $250 to nearly $275 in the last week, which seems unfair and unfortunate.I do recommend this luggage- great buy!",

    "reviewText": "Surprised at what great quality these even with the beautiful design! They’re everything I wanted in luggage: easy to maneuver/agile, sturdy, very* generous capacity, great internal zipper compartment to keep (plenty of) shoes (even boots and heels) and toiletries separate from clothes and other items, sturdy handles, and quality inner lining. Zippers are also thick and slide easily (my toddler can’t get enough of them and hasnt broken any yet and I’m not worried she will cuz they’re sturdy). My mid size one was heavily filled on a recent trip (packed 10 days into it plus dresses to attend a wedding, all without the zipper expander) and took a good tumble off the curb and slid a bit into the street on a slant when I wasn’t paying attention (tho it rolled standing upright with some finesse before going down) and came out with the casing pretty much unscathed, just a little mark on the handle where it hit, so I’m pretty confident these can handle being tossed in and out of a luggage trolley pretty well and maintain the nice exterior. Also, they just make me happy to see in the room during travel— they’re bright, have hummingbird animal spirit vibes, and my little girl seems to think they’re all for her! And if they truly hold the test of time by the time she’s big enough they will be :)",

The hard shell bubble heart exterior was a selling point for me but every detail beyond that was icing on the cake. I’m an “overpacker” to say the least and closing up a suitcase has always been the ultimate test of durability. It’s easy to close and easy to carry/roll around. The adorable gold/heart zippers and gold wheels are a nice touch. Not to mention each luggage comes with its own B.J. luggage tag. While the all black bubble heart set I ordered isn’t the typical bright and colorful Betsey Johnson look, the luggage tag adds the right pop of color and making finding my bags on the luggage carousel much easier!",

I love that each suitcase came with a rubber luggage tag <3. The dual side storage was the big plus for me. Most suitcases you have to stack everything and then try to close it. These suitcases have zipper enclosed storage in the base and lid so that you don't have to try to eyeball how much you can fit. The lining is also very cute. I loved that there are 4 wheels instead of just two making travel through airports a little easier without having to deal with the tilted weight of the suit case. This will be absolutely perfect for all the travel that I plan to do this year from a cross country road trip to a Caribbean cruise!",

    "reviewText": "I would not recommend buying this luggage set, in no way is it ‘hard shell’ or ‘extra thick’ material as advertised, or that you would expect from hard shell luggage. All 3 cases are made of cheap, thin, flimsy plastic, that bends easily when pushed. Nor does it have a textured finish to prevent scratches, it’s shiny and will scratch very easily. The zips are cheap and flimsy too, with some of the teeth already misshapen. This luggage set will not withstand airport handling, and is being returned.The seller has also stated on the advert, that they offer ‘free returns’ for ‘any reason’… This is not true, I generated a return, only to be told I am responsible for the return fee, and they will only refund up to £4.75 towards the return cost. The weight of the cases combined is around 26lbs, without the huge box it came in, so you can imagine what the cost of return will be!",

Held up through rolling over cobblestones at my resort. Very beautiful and I got compliments on it. I have the ivory so it did get dirty a little through baggage claim but I was able to wipe down with no issue.UPDATE 7-31-23 Just got back from another vacation to NYC. The luggage held up well. The only issue is the pulling handle became disengaged a couple times while I was moving it through the airport. I snapped it back up and it was ok. So far I have only used the largest suitcase for all my items so it was pretty heavy. I do like that it has handles on the side and the bottom that help in lifting it up off the baggage claim conveyor and also help to lift it from the ground into the car. It’s definitely a good set for the money.",

I love that it has packing cubes incorporated inside the luggage already. Also in the small bag, it looks like it has an option for a small umbrella which was a surprise. I can't say enough good things about this set. I also like the locking system. Although I did not find paperwork on how to change the lock. I may have missed it, but I had a similar locking system on another set of luggage I had, so it should not be a problem. There is always YOUTUBE to figure it out. I say buy it today, you will not be disappointed. It also maneuvers well. Good value for the money. It looks very durable. I would recommend getting covers for any luggage you have. They worked well on my last set.",

Internally, multiple zipped compartments help with organization while there's also the option to expand the size of the luggage. Overall, this is a nice hardshell luggage.",

I’m happy with this purchase and the deep red color is absolutely beautiful with the coordinating wheels.",

    "reviewText": "Gave 4 of 5 only because my zippers are currently a challenge. But... I love the smooth quilted look of the set as so many plastic hard cases today are textured and they tend to hurt and scuff my hands/nails.I had thought the color would be more of a mahogany red-brown, but it is a deep apple red. Still very nice. All 3 pieces are lightweight, and offer variety for travel needs. I really like the cinching strap option inside, instead of elastic. The wheels glide wonderfully, and the handles are very sturdy and feel secure.The zippers are my only frown. At the starting corners they stick mechanically and can take some finagling to align and get moving, but once engaged do okay. Otherwise I am very pleased with this set!",

    "reviewText": "First of all, the luggage comes wrapped in a plastic film that took me 2hours to get off, had to use an exacto knife around corners and edges to remove. Once off, luggage shines beautifully. Very cute set (I get a few compliments in the airpots when people see them) but not well made. Very thin plastic shell, wheels cute but too small for luggage to maneuver smoothly, if luggage is packed to the max it tips over when trying to roll. Ive taken all three pieces on two trips now, by the second trip, on arrival the smallest luggage, the plastic around wheel was busted after I checked it under the plane. These also do not expand or have a tsa lock. If you want cute luggage, go for it, if you want luggage that's going to last and be reliable I'd look elsewhere.",

    "reviewText": "I chose these because the reviews were pretty good and it was a nice looking set. Unfortunately the plastic coating ruins the looks because you can't get it off of all areas. I spent hours with tweezers trying to remove it. I also used an old credit card as a scraper which helped a little but I wrecked my nails AND my tweezers and still can't get it all off. Don't have much confidence that they will stay shiny if they had to be covered like that just for shipping.The case seems like flimsy plastic as are the handles, the zippers don't zip very smoothly; and it is NOT expandable as the description says. They aren't roomy, I filled the largest with quilts etc. just to test the wheels, it was packed full and only weighed 29 pounds. The one good thing I can say is that the wheels did move easily with that weight, although I wonder how they will do with heavier items. This was NOT what we were expecting as we thought Rockland was a good and dependable brand. I'm concerned on how these will hold up going through airlines, guess we'll be bringing duct tape along on our next trip for emergency fixes. Don't recommend these at all.",

    "reviewText": "The built in charger slash cup holder on this thing is great. Yeah, it's plastic, no it's not built to be abused but what is these days? It's a really nice feature to have waiting at the gates to change planes or anywhere you have limited access to power. I'm old, fat, and disturbingly clumsy but I had no trouble draggin this thing through ramps, escalators, elevators, moving walkways you name it. Like I said.... Clumsy, so I (repeatedly) bashed the wheels on this thing into walls, smacked the sides into car doors, posts, .......... Other people.... Oops. It took it all like a champ. I'm sure this thing will comply with all the airlines carryon rules.It will expand a bit by use of an expansion zipper so you can over stuff it if need be. If you need an inexpensive carry on that looks great and does the job this is your pick. One last thing. The expanding handle has been mentioned in other reviews as flimsy. Well, it's not made from pillars of steel that's true but I have had no problem with it.Update: July 2024 I read an extensive rather negative review about this piece of luggage and it's really unfortunate. Really my mind gets blown by some of these reviews. One complaint was that the USB charging feature was unreliable. Baloney. What's more likely is your portable battery is unreliable. It's a simple connection ok? Plug the battery in, zip it up in the pocket and then plug your phone , tablet, whatever in the other side. They make a ZILLION of those connectors in thousands of products every day, they rarely fail. Complaint: the color looks faded. What? Look at the picture. That's what you get. I call BS. Complaint: no compartments. Holy crap on a cracker. It's a CARRY ON. carry ons are SMALL. They are supposed to be........First time flyer? Complaint: cheap material and zippers. What are you......a gorilla? Unless you plan on a mid trip temper tantrum where you plan to grab this thing by the compartment divider and throw it at your equally angry spouse, it should last many years. Complaint: the lock was flimsy. WHAT LOCK? I didn't get a lock with mine. I have no idea what the reviewer was expecting from this luggage but it kinda seems like he expected a 300 dollar piece of Samsonite. And.....I gotta tell ya, the reality of that is well......Go ahead and over pay for something else if it makes you feel better.",

It also has a place for a portable charger so you can charge your phone without taking it out of your bag. I love it!",

    "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023",
    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Fails to Deliver on Promises",
    "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set with Cup Holder and USB Port in Olive Green, specifically the 20-Inch Carry-On model, with high hopes of a convenient and reliable travel companion. However, after using this luggage extensively, I can confidently say that it was a regrettable purchase. This thorough and detailed review aims to provide honest and unbiased feedback to potential buyers, highlighting the product's shortcomings and explaining why it fails to meet expectations. While I understand that experiences may vary, I believe it is important to share my personal encounter to help others make informed decisions.Design and Build Quality:The first impression of the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set was underwhelming. The olive green color appeared faded and lacked vibrancy, giving an overall cheap look. The material used in the construction of the luggage felt flimsy, and I had concerns about its durability even before my first trip. The zippers, handles, and wheels seemed poorly made, which raised doubts about their longevity.Functionality:The primary selling points of this luggage set are the built-in cup holder and USB port. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be more of a gimmick than practical additions. The cup holder is positioned on the side of the luggage, making it almost impossible to access when the bag is upright. Additionally, it lacks stability, causing drinks to spill easily, posing a risk to valuable belongings. As for the USB port, it was a complete disappointment. The charging function was unreliable, frequently disconnecting, and providing inconsistent power output. It is frustrating to have a luggage with such features that do not work as intended.Storage Capacity:The 20-Inch Carry-On model promised ample storage space. However, the design of the interior compartments was inefficient. The main compartment lacked dividers or organizing pockets, making it difficult to separate and locate items quickly. The flimsy lining tore after minimal use, compromising the overall structure of the luggage. Furthermore, the external pockets were not deep enough to accommodate larger items securely. The storage capacity did not live up to its claims, leading to constant reorganization and difficulty in packing efficiently.Maneuverability:One would expect a 20-inch carry-on to be easy to maneuver. Unfortunately, the wheels on the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set were a constant source of frustration. They lacked smooth rotation, often getting stuck or veering in awkward directions. Pushing or pulling the luggage required excessive effort, resulting in unnecessary strain during travel. The telescopic handle was loose and wobbly, adding to the overall inconvenience. Moving through busy airports or crowded streets became a tiresome task, and I found myself longing for a more reliable and effortless experience.Durability and Longevity:The build quality of the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set did not inspire confidence in its long-term durability. During my first trip, I noticed scuff marks and scratches on the exterior, suggesting poor resistance to rough handling. The wheels showed signs of wear and tear after minimal use, making me question their ability to withstand long journeys. The handle mechanism felt weak and unstable, leading me to worry about its potential failure in the future. Considering the price point of this luggage set, I expected a product that would withstand the rigors of travel, but sadly, it fell short in this aspect.Customer Service and Warranty:When I reached out to the customer service department regarding the issues I faced with my Wrangler Smart Luggage Set, I experienced further disappointment. Their response time was slow, taking days to reply to my initial query. Furthermore, their solutions were unsatisfactory, merely suggesting basic troubleshooting steps without addressing the specific concerns I had raised. The warranty provided was limited and did not cover several aspects of the product. It was evident that the company's commitment to customer satisfaction was lacking, leaving me feeling unsupported and frustrated.1. Security Concerns: Another aspect worth mentioning is the lack of security features in the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set. While it does come with a standard lock, it felt flimsy and provided minimal protection. The overall structure of the luggage did not inspire confidence in keeping belongings secure during travel. The absence of any additional security measures, such as TSA-approved locks or reinforced zippers, raises concerns about the safety of valuable items.2. Weight Distribution Issues: During my travels, I noticed significant weight distribution issues with this luggage set. Evenly distributing the weight across the wheels proved to be a challenge, resulting in imbalanced handling. This imbalance not only affected maneuverability but also caused the luggage to topple over easily, especially when navigating uneven surfaces or while in transit. It was frustrating to constantly struggle with a luggage that lacked stability.3. Inadequate Padding and Protection: The Wrangler Smart Luggage Set provided insufficient padding and protection for delicate items. The thin lining and lack of additional cushioning left items vulnerable to damage during transit. I found myself having to be overly cautious and packing extra layers of padding to ensure the safety of my belongings. For a product marketed as a smart luggage set, the lack of adequate protection was a significant disappointment.4. Limited Color Options: While personal preference may vary, it is worth noting that the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set offered limited color options. The olive green color, which I opted for, appeared dull and unattractive in person. It would have been beneficial to have a wider range of colors to choose from, allowing customers to select an option that suits their personal style and preferences.5. Price Point and Value for Money: Considering the price point of the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set, it is crucial to evaluate its value for money. Unfortunately, this product falls short in terms of quality, functionality, and durability, making it an unsatisfactory investment. There are alternative luggage options available in the market that offer better features, sturdier build quality, and superior customer support within a similar price range.Conclusion:In conclusion, I cannot recommend the Wrangler Smart Luggage Set with Cup Holder and USB Port, Olive Green, 20-Inch Carry-On to anyone seeking reliable, functional, and durable luggage. From the poor design and build quality to the lack of functionality, this product falls short on multiple fronts. The storage capacity is inefficient, maneuverability is subpar, and the promised features like the cup holder and USB port are more hassle than convenience. Moreover, the questionable durability, coupled with disappointing customer service, further diminishes its value. I highly recommend exploring other options that offer better quality and functionality within a similar price range.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Samsonite Saga: A Family Affair",
    "reviewText": "I don't typically review products immediately after purchase. I prefer to use them extensively to form a truly honest opinion. This Samsonite Freeform 2-piece set, purchased back in August, has now been put through its paces and has proven to be an exceptional travel companion (for someone other than myself, though!). Let me explain:I purchased this Samsonite Freeform Hardside Expandable 2-Piece Set with my daughter in mind, as she was about to embark on her year-long study abroad adventure. Needing a new carry-on myself, I decided to invest in this bundle. The price was surprisingly affordable for Samsonite, so I opted for the stylish navy color.The moment I laid my hands on these suitcases, I was impressed by their lightweight design. Despite their spacious interiors, they feel surprisingly light when fully packed. The smooth-rolling spinner wheels glide effortlessly, making navigating busy airports a breeze. The expandable feature is a game-changer, allowing for extra packing space. The built-in TSA-approved locks provide peace of mind. The interior compartments are well-designed, making packing and unpacking a breeze. The telescopic handle is sturdy and extends smoothly, making it easy to maneuver the suitcase.Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived. My daughter, smitten with the Samsonite's sleek design and effortless maneuverability, claimed my carry-on as her own. She justified her theft by claiming she needed it for her frequent weekend trips. I guess she couldn't exactly \"find herself\" without a stylish suitcase!While I initially mourned the loss of my beloved carry-on, I can't deny the quality and functionality of Samsonite luggage.Overall, the Samsonite Freeform Hardside Expandable 2-Piece Set is a fantastic investment for frequent travelers. If you're looking for luggage that can withstand the test of time and make your travels more enjoyable, I highly recommend this set. Just be prepared to defend your luggage from family members who may have a sudden case of \"luggage envy.\"",

    "reviewText": "So I just got the 24-inch size, after previously getting a set of the 21-inch and 28-inch. With the size difference between the 21-inch carry-on model and the 28-inch checked baggage size, there is of course no problem with putting the smaller one inside the 28-inch.Unfortunately the 21-inch, like all carry-on luggage, really only holds enough for a couple of days by itself. So I wanted to get the 24-inch middle size. Anything larger than 21 inches will need to be checked, in case anyone is still not sure about that. Some airlines will even complain if your 21-inch case is expanded and can't fit easily in the provided metal frame baggage size tester you see at a lot of gates or check-in counters. So be careful about leaving the 21-inch size expanded when you're actually trying to use it as a carry-on.I was hesitant to order the 24-inch because I wasn't certain that it would successfully nest inside the 28-inch model. I could find no information on this in the answered questions or anywhere in online reviews of these exact \"Freeform\" luggage models. The dimensional difference between the 24 and 28-inch models isn't nearly as much as between the 21 and 28-inch models.This is potentially very important if you either A) live in a very small place to begin with, or B) wind up in a very cramped hotel room (or even just one with a really awkward layout) where they don't provide a decent spot to store both a 24-inch and a 28-inch luggage case separately without one of them really being in the way. Closets are typically just big enough to store one or the other size, but probably not both if you can't nest them first. Trying to stack them vertically will typically just use up all available space for hanging outerwear in an already tiny hotel closet.I took a chance and ordered it anyway, without knowing the answer. The news is mostly good. I found that the 21-inch fits easily within the 24-inch. So that was a very good start. But the 28-inch won't quite close with the 24-inch inside. Not nearly as easily as when I fit the 21-inch into the 24-inch. Seems like the 24-inch is a bit too thick. Luckily, all three models have an expansion zipper around the middle. Once the largest case is expanded, the main zipper will successfully close all the way around with the 24-inch inside.So, technically, you can nest all three together, 21/24/28, as a set. You just have to expand the 28-inch case first. The complete set of three cases will then take up a couple of inches more room than expected in the front-side to back-side dimension wherever you decide to store it. I don't think I would recommend trying to compress it to re-close the expansion zipper and then leave it that way in long term storage. Probably not a good idea.As for a review of the cases themselves, they have been pretty sturdy so far, and they are pretty lightweight without really feeling flimsy at all. The double wheels on each corner provide more stability and ability to roll over slightly rough surfaces like tiled walkways, moderate carpeting and asphalt, compared to spinner cases that only put a single inline-skate type wheel on each corner. I really dislike those. And of course they are all spinners, which is a far superior arrangement to tilt-and-roll types of luggage. You can actually put quite a large bag (like a ~30LB backpack) on top of any of these sizes and still roll the whole thing around on its four wheels without too much trouble. The larger sizes will be more stable, but even the 21-inch isn't too bad.Put two of these spinners back to back and it's not too difficult to hold the extended handles together with one hand and angle the two so that you can use your knee behind the larger one to get it going, and then push the smaller one along in front of the bigger one. Once they start moving it works out pretty well.The sides are plastic and tend to develop a lot of static when the humidity is low. So you may wind up with a lot of dust/hair all over them if you lay them down on a carpet before a thorough vacuuming. Rubbing the outside with a dryer sheet may help with this.Some colors seem to have a glossy finish. The navy blue and others have a sort of tiny diamond-shaped matte texture except in the grooves. They will all get scratched as soon as they go through even a single airport baggage system. It may be less obvious on the lighter colors. But the really light colors will show the black marks from luggage belts much more easily. Just remember that they are hard sided, so no outer pockets or fabric on front/back to get torn up easily like soft-sided luggage, and they have expansion zippers, which a lot of hard-sided luggage don't include. So just pick the color you like and try not to worry about it. And they do go on sale now and then. I was able to get the first set of 21/28 for under two hundred. I think they are kind of overpriced most of the time.",

It’s a hard-shell suitcase designed for overhead storage on planes, with TSA-approved dimensions. It has good capacity, is expandable, and lightweight. I really like it; I feel comfortable traveling with it, and most importantly, it has a combination security lock. I highly recommend it, and I would definitely buy it again because Samsonite is the best luggage brand out there, despite what some may say. My experiences with Samsonite have always been positive. Excellent product❤️",

    "reviewText": "I gave this one star because I couldn’t give it zero. These suitcases broke immediately. We took them from SLC to CLT, but the carry-on barely made it through the SLC airport. I handled it carefully, pulling it by the telescoping handle as intended. Right away, I noticed the telescoping handle was of poor quality, as it wiggled significantly while extending. Shortly after pulling it through the airport, the handle broke completely off. The inside fabric pockets are made of very thin, cheap material that started tearing after just one packing—and I didn’t even pack the bag that full. The zipper is also very low quality, often failing to connect without needing to unzip and rezip several times. We ended up struggling to navigate through our destination airport with broken suitcases and twin babies, and the return trip was no better. These suitcases were supposed to make our experience easier, but they couldn't even last one trip, which is baffling.",

    "reviewText": "This luggage was perfect on my recent travels, both for the durability, ease of moving it through airports, and for the awesome visibility that allowed me to identify it immediately in the sea of black and grey baggage everyone else was carrying. It was also a surprising ice breaker in long layovers, many individuals complimented the luggage and it started some great conversations with sweet strangers from all over, an added bonus I wasn't expecting. I think the best part, is that I have it back home now, and it still looks as new as when I removed it from the shipping packaging. Thank you thank you thank you!",

    "reviewText": "This set of luggage looks expensive, but isn’t! It’s lightweight while constructed to be rugged. The wheels allow you to navigate all terrain’s. Plenty of space is available with or without the expandable zipper. The strap on the back of smaller case allows you to attach it to the handle on the suitcase, you can use two fingers to push two suitcases with ease! I love how the zippers hook into the lock and how conveniently they’re positioned. These cases roll with ease and the handles are sturdy. The rigid construction protects your belongings. Would definitely recommend!",

    "reviewText": "TLDR: Great set with plenty of options for any kind of travel!I've been on a luggage kick recently, I went on a quick trip where all I brought along was my carry-on- everyone else on this trip had a spinner suitcase and I had my trusty old fabric two-wheeler. Know what? Going completely to the opposite side of ATL dragging that behind me was the pits. I also got gate checked, twice. My trusty case was worse for the wear after that trip, so I started researching. I ordered several different styles of spinner cases to find the right one for me, individually running $100-$200 and when I received these, I sent them all back - and not just because this set is a bargain.These come in one box, Russian-doll style, which means that they're easy to stow away. They all have telescoping handles and spinner wheels except the 14\" case. The largest 3 have TSA approved locks and the 4th has a built in combination lock. They're lightweight, but more durable feeling than the other cases I tried. The interiors are well designed with pockets and zippers and those click together straps of holding. I could fit more into the 20\" in this design than in the others.There is also a surprising amount of room inside the 14\", I was able to pack a pair of jeans, lightweight long sleeved top, vitamins, deodorant, and a thin full sized throw blanket inside without any issue - it's a fantastic one night case - or as it's intended - for your bathroom odds and ends.I love that there is an 18\" AND 20\", so all of your carryon needs are taken care of. And, you can check the 24\" with your fully packed 20\" inside so there's plenty of room for the souvenirs on the way home! Or conversely, you can always open the expansion zippers and give yourself that extra wiggle room.The 28\" is massive. Looking forward to using that primarily for family road trips - one suitcase to rule them all. Imagine that? Everyone packed into one suitcase in the back of the car, no tetris-ing necessary.",

Our largest bag was cracked (see photo) the first time a baggage handler got their hands on it and the zipper broke on the next largest the second time we used it. We travel a fair amount and need something that can withstand being flung around. Unfortunately, if you’re a heavy traveler - especially one who flies and checks luggage - this is not the set for you. Don’t make the mistake I did by not heeding advice from other reviewers.",

    "reviewText": "This luggage set is very pretty, the wheels maneuver from parking lot into airport with no issue, and each piece of luggage has a lot of room albeit there is however a flaw. It is with the largest piece, the checked bag. The handle at the top, not the telescoping handle but the stationary handle broke extremely easily. The luggage weighed in at 31.3 pounds at the check in counter so it was not overweight but when I arrived at my destination and grabbed the handle to put the luggage in the back of the car, the handle just snapped off on one side. My son was able to cut it completely off so I wouldn't cut myself on the metal piece that the cloth covers so that the luggage is still usable. Just disappointing about the handle being so weak however, aside from that flaw the luggage did very well on my roundtrip and I will use the set again. Just be mindful of those handles.",

They looked beautiful and all 3 pieces were exactly what I needed.I flew out to Omaha with the large bag and everything was great. It was so easy to maneuver throughout the airport terminals and I never felt like it was difficult to move or control.It was large enough to store everything I had and wasn’t even close to being full. When I got home after my trip I rolled the bag into my bedroom and that’s when I noticed the huge tear on the top front panel. Thank goodness I’m within my return window because I’m sending them back and getting a full refund. I considered getting a replacement bag, but I figure the same thing will happen again because they’re obviously not that well made. I hate having to give 1 star, but unfortunately the quality just isn’t there.",

    "reviewText": "All three bags were shipped in one single box and were packed inside of each other (thank you Amazon for not wasting boxes!). Their sizes and ability to fit inside of each other are perfect for reducing storage space when not in use. They also arrived a day earlier than expected! I chose this set mainly because of the stylish exteriors and was very pleased to see that they look exactly as pictured online.The variety of sizes allows you to switch up suitcases with different trips. I took the smallest size with me on a three day weekend trip out of town and was able to fit three complete outfits (two bottoms, two tops, a dress, & one pair of shoes), my makeup bag, and a couple travel-sized toiletries all in the one bag! I took the largest suitcase on a week-long trip out of town and had plenty of room for my many souvenirs on the way back, I didn't even have to use the zipper that extended the bag. I probably could have taken that one large suitcase on a three-week vacation with all of the room inside!I love how I can easily pull/push my suitcases when they are standing upright (because of the 360 degree spinning wheels) instead of dragging them behind me. The two smaller bags are perfect sizes for a carry-on and personal item on airlines (I tested it myself!).My only complaint is that the material stains easily. After my first 1.5hr nonstop flight, I was disappointed to pull my bag off the luggage carousel and find several dark stains over the front, back, and corners of the exterior. After my returning flight back home, I found several new stains. Nothing in my bag leaked, so I assumed the cause was from other luggage or oil in the cargo bay. I was not able to get the stains out with fabric cleaner once I returned home.Overall, I am pleased with the bags for their price. I 100% recommend purchasing a protection plan with the suitcases though because they will definitely get stained from flying. Other than that, sizes are perfect and bags have plenty of storage compartments and zipper pouches. 360 degree spinning wheels make mobility easy. And the style is beautiful!",

    "reviewText": "I’ve had my eye on this Steve Madden Harlo Black Luggage Set since last Winter when I “lent” my old set to a friend, who abused the bags and they smelled like smoke, so I didn’t want them back.I’ve seen this set and/or separate pieces at higher prices elsewhere, then found it here on Amazon and put it on my Shopping list. Then COVID-19 hit, and my travel plans were cancelled so I didn’t order. Fast-forward to the end of June…With a last-minute trip scheduled, I made the purchase at such a great price with quick shipping. Now we’re ba-ack from our first trip and happy together! Here’s why:The 360-degree spinners don’t add to the height of the luggage which is all-important for carry-on bags. They also were excellent for the necessary starting and stopping at the airports to navigate the TSA maze and so many travelers over the holiday while maintaining social distancing.In addition to the sturdy, maneuverable wheels and affordable pricing, I gave this set 5 stars because:1- I wanted a set with classic lines that would still be distinguishable from other luggage in the overhead bin and on the baggage carousel without the loud colors and styles that are so popular today.2- The design closely matches the overnight/underseat bag from my old set. (It’s pictured with the others from last night’s arrival home.)3- Gotta love the bag tag that refers to shoes (always admired Madden’s shoes and accessories) because I pack so many on every trip!4- The tassels are a nice touch. I hang them from the zippers for easy opening and I don’t mix up the open/expand zippers.5- My TSA-approved locks slide right in the zipper holes.6- The bags stack inside each other as they arrived for minimal storage space.***Check out the pictures for all of the above***AND, SO IMPORTANT: I had a minor issue with one bag. I reached out to the Seller and received an almost instantaneous reply from a Fashion Luggage rep who resolved it for me. I’m impressed with the product quality and the stellar customer service from this family-owned business based in the USA.I’d gladly do business with them again and look forward to many trips with this luggage, and I would recommend both to friends and family.",

The large cases are deep and roomy. I had no trouble pulling the cases through the airport. This is my first set of luggage with 4 wheels on the bottom and I would not go back to the 2 wheel pull type. These are easy to maneuver and light weight. The color is dark purple with black over tone. The best piece is the carry on bag. It's deep with lots of pockets and has a hard frame so it keeps It's shape, again very roomy. I especially liked the side opening for easy accsess. This piece only has 2 wheels so it's a pull type vs a push. The pop-up handles on all pcs where long and easily accessible and easy to retract. This was the first time using this set and I didn't see any scuffing or damage on the outside from loading the luggage. Time will tell. The only thing I didn't like were all the tassels on the zipper pulls. They look nice but get in the way. They're clip on so I removed them with no problem. I would recommend this luggage.",

I saw one review describing it as “flimsy”; please ignore. It’s even better than advertised. In the video I only had one free hand, but unzipping is seamless. I opened that part to show where it expands. I can’t adequately emphasize how pretty this set is. Also, the two smaller pieces fit inside the largest piece. The material is sone form of nylon, and it’s very sturdy and durable. It glides whole rolling it. It serves its purpose well and is SO stylish. IT’s A MUST HAVE!!",

The zippers began slightly pulling apart the first time we packed them so I should have known. Very expensive any extremely low quality. Honestly, I've owned a lot of different pieces in my 47 years and Walmart brand Swiss gear held up better. This is like dollar store luggage that looks really pretty but it's not functional I don't have photos because we were forced to leave the luggage at different stations as it was falling apart. And yes, half of our clothing and essentials we gave to the homeless at the stations. Really there were no options",

    "reviewText": "I bought this set as an afterthought and was a bit in a hurry to have a new set for a trip. I spent a couple of days, at 3-4 hours each, browsing for luggage. Can’t tell you how much fun that was🙄. I decided on my set of burgundy, trio 28”24”20”. The fact is; this luggage is not just good, but very good. Certain things are important as in the wheels and casters, zippers, compartments and outer shell material.The wheels are quality metal with polyurethane treads. (Very quiet for hotel hallways or concrete and wooden floors). Each piece spins nicely and doesn’t drag.The zippers are strong and metal. They glide nicely and don’t usually hang up when shutting or opening. The outer material is very tough and should never tear or give me any problems. The burgundy color with black trim looks very cool and I even received a compliment. The inside compartments are the standard pockets with decent elastic and quality zippers on them also. I really enjoy the built in combination locks. I have been accustomed to using small padlocks and carrying keys. The outside of the luggage has two zippered compartments with same strong zippers and work well. The handles on them are plastic but I see no reason why I should have any issues with them. They extent nicely, lock in the right places, and extend extremely long so I don’t need to slouch or lean to pull them behind me. I am 5’10”The insides are lined in satin type material that should hold up over time. All three pieces for under $200 seems like a bargain to me. I’m satisfied with the purchase and recommend the type and brand.",

The army green color is nice and subtle, but helps to differentiate it from all the black luggage in the world. The luggage is sturdy and light, and the wheels roll smoothly and are easy to maneuver.My only complaint is that the handles drop back in too easily. I'll be walking along, pushing my luggage on all 4 wheels with the handle up, and it will just drop unexpectedly. Even if I don't push the button at all, the handles will drop. It's a minor inconvenience, but it is annoying, hence only 4 stars instead of 5.",

    "reviewText": "This luggage set is everything it promises to be and more. The quality is very sturdy with plenty of room to pack what you need and then some. No problems with the sturdy zippers. The 360° wheels roll great and they make the luggage easier to maneuver. The carry on is roomy and can accommodate quite a bit of items you might need on the plane, train, and/or bus; plus the extra items you might need should your claimed piece of luggage doesn’t arrive when you do. The built in locks are TSA approved and sturdy. I bought the purple set with 2 thoughts in mind, 1) it would be easier to spot at baggage claim and 2) I’m mad about purple!",

    "reviewText": "My daughter bought a set of this and was happy with it. So, I bought a set. I love the green color, and it's easy to pick out on the belt. On our second trip (less than a year), the airline broke a wheel. I was upset to think my set was ruined. I contacted the company to see if I could get a replacement wheel. They sent the complete assembly to me (less than 3 weeks from China) at no cost!!! We were pleasantly surprised by this. My daughter needs another set, and plans to get another one now.",

    "reviewText": "Great price for 3 piece set of luggage. Multi directional wheels, largest bag fully packed comes in just below 50 lb limit on airlines. Just took largest piece through checked baggage, packed to point of just barely able to zip shut. Weight measured 46.8 lbs on trip out, and 48.2 lbs on trip back (shoved few souvenirs in bag for trip back). Smallest bag is great carry on and fits below seat at feet if no overhead storage available.Took one star off for production smell. Strong chemical smell when unpacked manufacturing puts each piece in plastic bag upon completion. Needs time for off gassing of urethane used in system. Took two weeks of airing out bags before smell dissipated.Happy with use so far, many car trips, two airline trips, no sign of wear.",

    "reviewText": "Just got off a 7 day cruise to Alaska, and decided I needed a suitcase upgrade, as my old 2 wheel duffel would barely close on the contents, returning.The Samsonite arrived intact, big and beautiful, just as pictured.The wheels, locks, extendable handle and zippers all work smoothly, so am good to go.I've read the surface scratches, which is disappointing, but a hard case that doesn't simply does not exist, I think, as the reviews on all the other models noted they did, as well, so just have to live with it, I guess.As long as it remains in one piece, and contains the contents, with working wheels and zippers, I'll be satisfied.The lock system seems a little fragile, just being the zipper tips inserted into holes, with a latching bar running thru it.However, it's not a concern for me, as my duffel had no lock, and I never pack anything other than clothes, toiletries and a book or two, so not a prime target for potential thievery, I think.Overall, I really like it, at this point.I'm hopefully traveling to Kenya in February, and will return to edit this review when I return.",

    "reviewText": "We purchased this three piece hard side set to replace an older two piece Samsonite soft side set we’ve had for many years and needed to be retired. We always have had soft side luggage but thought we’d try the hard side version for a change and found this Centric 2 set for what we thought was a pretty good price.On receiving the luggage, our first thought was that the outer hard shell was more flexible than we anticipated and I was skeptical about the durability of the luggage. But all three pieces made their maiden cross country plane trip intact and fairly unscathed. Yes, the luggage had some light scratches and scuffing, but that was minor, and the zippers, wheels, handles all came through with flying colors. I read a couple of other reviews where the zippers were an issue but I think they are pretty heavy duty and we had no issues with them. Same for the wheels. The wheels stick out more than those on our old set but they appear pretty solid and roll like a dream.We stuffed all three pieces full for our trip but really packed a lot in the large suitcase and it was a little tough to close. Not horrendously so but I was concerned about the zipper breaking so I thought it might be a good idea to use the expandable feature. Nice idea, that took the excess strain off of the zipper, but I found that the top flexed way too much and I thought this might create more of a problem when the bag was loaded and unloaded off of the planes. So I zippered the expandable part back up and we made it home without mishap.PROS: We really appreciate the fact that all three pieces fit inside of each other for combined storage, something that our old set couldn’t do. We like the TSA friendly locks and how they are out of the way. The interior zippered compartments are very nice. The wheels, as mentioned earlier, seem pretty durable and roll like a dream. Pretty light weight, no where near as heavy as our old soft side set.CONS: Okay, this is nitpicking, but the outer shell will get scratched and scuffed. Anybody that has flown knows how tough baggage handling can be. And the description does say “scratch resistant” not scratch proof. I thought our bags came through our trip pretty well. Lastly, not that this matters to us but the carry on has a built in charger for phones, tablets, etc. but you have to buy the battery separately. We don’t care and will probably never use it but just letting you know incase you missed that in the description.",

Absolutely unacceptable! This should never happen! What makes things worse is even though there’s a 10 year warranty - Will Samsonite replace it? NOPE - they expect me to “ship” it to them and then IF they can repair it - and they feel it’s “under warranty” they’ll fix it and if not - I can opt to have it repaired at my expense….UNACCEPTABLE! I paid too much money for these and to have service like that? Deplorable! Will never EVER buy Samsonite again!",

It was a very sturdy but older collection of American Tourister luggage and it died on me my last travel moving from the states to Germany because of my job so I took a gamble and bought this luggage. My luggage was overweight by normal standards of any American based airlines, but they look the best my luggage have ever been traveling. I had some liquids in my checked bags. Nothing broke. You just had to dust off the dust and they looked brand new. Honestly, for the price I paid. I’m mad I didn’t buy two sets, but these are definitely my favorite luggage.",

I am not sure the airline would call you on the size as long as you were under their 50 pound max but in researching reviews, I found that if they do object, the fines can be quite steep so unfortunately I returned it and the search is on for another",

They swivel easily and have a handle on top,side, and bottom to make lifting them easier. The smallest one has a handle on the top & side only.

    "reviewText": "Purchased this set for my wife. She say: I fell in love with the picture of this set. It looked elegant and sassy. We bought this set b/c the carry on bag and checked bag fits size for American Air. Small bag is too big to use as a personal item but ordered anyway b/c it is cute and can be used for ground travel. Set came quickly and fits inside each other. Baggage is large inside and seems to be well made. Love the little tassels on the front. Did not notice any weird smells other posters had mentioned. THE BAD: The compression straps inside the suitcase are not elastic. I've never seen that before and it didn't work well. But the really bad is that the color looks different in person vs the picture and that’s the reason for 4 stars. Luscious Silver set has a purple tint. Looks like the cloth inside a casket. Makes them look like cheap/knockoff bags. In the picture its's silver. I'm going to attach a pic as well but it doesn't really show up purple in my pic either. Believe me in person it is obvious. And you will see in the pic the zipper isn't sewn on straight. And the leather(?) around one of the zippers is flaking off like the zipper got stuck on it. Just not high quality. I kept the bags anyway b/c we had travel plans. Have flown with the set twice and they held up well. They are easy to spot on luggage carousel. The cloth did have a few picks in fabric after flying and handling but still looks ok. Wheels roll in all directions well and smoothly. A little harder to roll on carpet but on other floors I could roll easily. Happy w/set except for the color.",

    "reviewText": "I rarely take the time to submit reviews, but felt compelled to in this case. I did a LOT of searching for a new luggage set for a two-week girls' trip through Scotland & Ireland, and finally decided on this set - I'm so happy I did! On & off the tour bus, approx. seven different hotel changes, four flights, and they held up beautifully. I used the smallest as my carry-on bag, and it was the perfect size. On a smaller plane they made others store their carry-on bags separately, but I was able to keep mine with me because it was just small enough. The largest bag is expandable and I was able to (with the help of packing cubes) cram a lot in and still stay under 50 lbs. A great price and so stylish! I felt quite fancy rolling these pieces through the airport ;) and they stood out from the rest. The only issue was that I put too many items in the clear pocket in the smallest bag and the plastic pulled away from the fabric on one side - just a caution to others who may buy this set - but I definitely still recommend it!",

    "reviewText": "I'm definitely not impressed with this set. The only pluses are the look & pockets. The blue is incredible and so gorgeous in person, the pictures do it no justice at all. I ordered two sets (first set had a lining zipper sewed on so wrong it wouldn't zip up the last 5 inches and left a gaping hole through to where the handle pulls up) and both sets had some kind of manufacturing issues. The stitching is a little loose and on the second set they completely went off the fabric of the expansion zipper for about three inches. Pull handle on the smallest case is wobbly. I only kept and used because I ran out of time to mess around shopping for another set. Definitely not the quality I was expecting for the price I paid. But they're very roomy and function well.P.S. I have never left a review but considering the crap I went through, I figured it was worth warning people.",

With the very welcome plastic protector that comes with it, it kept the suitcase in beautiful condition. It wheels effortlessly, plus fits on top of my mobility walker easily. This set looks and feels like high-end luggage, and is absolutely beautiful. It’s sturdy, but also lightweight. It’s very stylish and classic, but still bold and unique. I got so many compliments from flight attendants, airline employees, and passengers on the matching train case. I wore it as a purse, cross-body style, and it fit under the seat. When I got asked, and said I got it on Amazon, they were always surprised. Don’t hesitate to get this if you are trying to decide. I take all reviews with a grain of salt, but trust me- mind is real. I love it!",

    "reviewText": "I bought these cases primarily on looks and bc the sizes work for air travel. I was a little concerned that they would not wear well, because they were described as \"light-weight\" luggage. But, my fear were unfounded.The cases are lovely, are very well built, and I appreciate the features of the straps to hold one side, and the zipped dust cover on the other side. And the fact that most of it can fit together when not in use is a great space-saver.I put some mink oil on it to age it a little and also to help it resist dirt and scuffs. I plan to clean it with saddle soap. Not because any of this is real leather, but because I already have those products and they will work fine on these synthetic materials.Overall, I think this is a very well-designed set of luggage and I'm glad I bought it.",

I used the rolling bag on a recent trip and had no issues - it was easy to roll through the airport and the plane aisle, and fit well in the overhead bin on the plane. Great purchase!",

    "reviewText": "SO PRECIOUS!! I got it to replace my old cheetah print suitcase, so cute and have gotten so many compliments!! it come with a clear case to protect the larger luggage, which is super convenient considering the airlines don’t care about your stuff! The cover saved it from several scuffs already, just from my trip to and from Cali. Only downside is that it’s not the most durable material, it’s more like a faux leather which I kinda was hoping it was printed on a canvas material. The faux leather gets “chipped” kinda bad if something pokes it. It’s not expandable, but it has a good amount of space. The wheels are great and easy to navigate around. The pattern is amazing and super bright!!",

And now I'm buying this set for my other daughter for Christmas this year. The price has come down since I bought mine which is awesome. I do not fly very often this is just more for weekend trips and it's perfect. Definitely not big enough for over a week. The matching case is so adorable I would have bought it by itself.",

    "reviewText": "These are very nice. Well made. Appear as pictured. The wheels roll very smoothly both when in upright position and when tilted. The smaller \"personal item\" comes with a long shoulder strap for convenient carrying and a short strap that keeps it resting snug on top of your roll-around luggage without falling should you not want to carry it separately. It also has really sturdy studs on one side of it that prop it upright and keep it from sliding around when stowed under the seat in front of you on a flight. Have only had it for a few weeks and two trips so I don't know how it stands up to time, but it looks like it will hold up nicely. The larger bag also comes with a plastic luggage protector, which was a nice surprise.I got no less than 4 complements about my classy looking luggage on my most recent trip, mostly from flight attendants. 100% would buy again and probably will by more pieces. My only grievance is i wish there were more color options. Navy and white or light grey would be to die for!",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Not Great at Maneuverability",
    "reviewText": "UPDATE: After spending a significant amount of time looking into warranty information on this set, I've discovered that this is NOT true Travelpro luggage.It's made by Travelpro, but it turns out it's a low quality set made for discount retailers. It's not even listed on their website and appears to have no warranty backing. I have had Travelpro for several years so, when the time came for a new set, I hopped on Amazon, found a set that I liked (and was happy to have scored a great deal) and purchased it (shame on me, I guess). I was completely unaware that Travelpro had watered down their product line and were pushing substandard items.It feels like a terrible bait and switch from a company that used to mean quality and durability. If you can, spend the extra money for the Platinum or Maxlite lines or switch brands completely, like I may be doing soon.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I love Travelpro luggage and this is my second set from Amazon (I travel about 40% of the year) but this set is just really frustrating me.The carryon tips over with anything set on top. Neither case rolls particularly easily, but the carryon is a nightmare. The wheels seem to \"snag\" constantly and the whole thing tips over while I'm rolling it, even on flat hard surfaces.I'm trying to look into warranty options, hoping I got a lemon and it's not a flaw with all of this line. I've been shopping other brands recently due to the issues I'm having traveling with this set.",

These roll beautifully but I went for a little more expense and even easier wheels. So you can make your trade off! Bon Voyage!",

All three of my rollaboard bags (this one and 2 MaxLite 5s) packed with the same weight, and have taken the same journeys, the approximate same number of times.The under the seat bag tore within the first two months. Now the rollaboard handle on this one is trashed after only 9 months of use. Even if I had purchased the warranty on these bags, I would still chose to replace them with the MaxLite 5 instead. This model simply does not hold up nearly as well.",

    "reviewText": "UPDATE: After spending a significant amount of time looking into warranty information on this set, I've discovered that this is NOT true Travelpro luggage.It's made by Travelpro, but it turns out it's a low quality set made for discount retailers. It's not even listed on their website and appears to have no warranty backing. I have had Travelpro for several years so, when the time came for a new set, I hopped on Amazon, found a set that I liked (and was happy to have scored a great deal) and purchased it (shame on me, I guess). I was completely unaware that Travelpro had watered down their product line and were pushing substandard items.It feels like a terrible bait and switch from a company that used to mean quality and durability. If you can, spend the extra money for the Platinum or Maxlite lines or switch brands completely, like I may be doing soon.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I love Travelpro luggage and this is my second set from Amazon (I travel about 40% of the year) but this set is just really frustrating me.The carryon tips over with anything set on top. Neither case rolls particularly easily, but the carryon is a nightmare. The wheels seem to \"snag\" constantly and the whole thing tips over while I'm rolling it, even on flat hard surfaces.I'm trying to look into warranty options, hoping I got a lemon and it's not a flaw with all of this line. I've been shopping other brands recently due to the issues I'm having traveling with this set.",

    "reviewText": "This luggage is beautiful. I have been wanting to purchase this for a year now. I tried to make my photos as detailed as possible because the reviews I’ve seen just didn’t have everything I wanted to know/see. This is the carry on 20in with the little carrying case. The protective cover does come with it! I was worried it only came with the big ones. I intentionally took my photos in front of the fridge so you can get a good idea of the size. It is not as tall as my freezer. This carry on would suit me perfectly for a week long trip. I do not do checked luggage, we all know how airports handle luggage. I don’t recommend getting this suitcase if you intend to check it. This should be carry on only, for trains, or road trips in ANY size. It is sturdy but something this elegant needs to be cared and looked after. If you want a travel bag you can beat up, look elsewhere. This is the first luggage set I have ever bought and I am so happy with it. I can’t wait to serve looks in the airport.",

The handbag does have a small flaw where when it unlocks it'll get stuck with the handle. But you just have to angle it to lock it. The wheels are so smooth! Spins really nice and quiet.",

The carryon bag is roughly 4in deep, 12in long. The wheels are really smooth, I was walking in a circle with it in my kitchen & it didn’t want to tip over or anything (it was empty). The pull handle has a button that you push down to adjust the height of it. It also has a water proof cover for the suitcase (not the carryon) & a bag for the inside to cover your clothes (so they don’t fly around I guess?). It’s also just extremely cute & I can’t wait to use it!",

    "reviewText": "Loved this set when I saw it and HAD to have it. It was even prettier in person when I got it. That’s the good part. The bad part far outweighs the beauty of it. If you’re going to use it on vacation make sure you bring two other bags because these hold nothing. Normal suitcases have 2 sides you can load up stuff in, this one only has one side and half of it has the metal roller bars in it and the other side had a “net” that you put some nail polish bottles in it and MAYBE a book if it wasn’t a big book. For a normal four day trip I had to bring all four suitcases, (I bought the big one which had a little one in it and then I bought the smaller one which also had a little one in it). Then, if you’re dumb enough like me and brought it on a plane and let the thugs that throw around your luggage, Will most definitely ruin it. The very first time I used it, when I got to my destination and saw what was left on my bag that came off the carousel was unbelievable! It’s seriously looked like I had dragged it around for years. All the rose gold snaps and locks were all scratched up, the white straps that snap close, one of them is gone. it’s so flimsy and so not durable that I would say the only thing it is good for is to make your room look prettier. It’s not super sturdy, the rollers were not very good, I had to lift it over every threshold because it wouldn’t go over. I’m keeping the two little bags for carry-ons but the other two are ruined. So don’t spend 250 or $500 for this beautiful luggage unless you’re just leaving it out for show So you will not be as disappointed as I was.",

The interior is beautifully constructed and the fabric for the liner is far better than what you'd expect from a luggage set that's less than $200. I'm going on my first cruise at the end of the month and I'm hoping that I'm just as impressed with how they survived being tossed around and that the overall construction is just as good as the interior. PS - I love the red color! My only negative so far is that the shipping box was cheap quality and it was delivered falling apart and broken open on the end with the wheels. On initial examination the product appears to be undamaged.",

The wheels worked well for me esp since I am somewhat handicapped. The cases both have exterior locks and adjustable handles.And, \"No\" I don't work for the company--I just really like these suitcases!",

My pictures don't do it justice - the color is pretty \"French lipstick red\". I was happy to find the large spinner case is lightweight. It has 2 study handles (one on the top, one on the side) and the wheels move very easily. It comes with a heavy duty plastic case to protect it when wheeling it in inclement weather (one pic shows how the plastic cover attaches with Velcro underneath the case). I found that the large case will hold enough items for about a week's travel, and the small case holds a change of clothes for overnight. Each case has pockets sewn in to hold smaller clothing or toiletry items. The small case comes with 2 additional straps - one shoulder strap which is adjustable, and a strap that fits over the handle of the larger case, to hold the small case in place, so you can roll both cases at once. I'm really happy with this purchase!",

I told her to get something different and a pattern that would stand out from all of the other luggage at the airport. We could not find anything that she liked locally. She found this set online and really liked it. The pictures really do not do it justice. In case you are trying to match it to existing luggage, it has a cream background with a peachy orange and purple map pattern. The inside is gray and off-white stripes. The luggage seems to be very sturdy and rolls very nice. The small case is a great size for her toiletries.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful, but much smaller than expected",
    "reviewText": "Initially, I only wanted a 3-piece set to include the 26”, 20”, and 12”. However, after messaging the seller, I was told that they only sell the bags in sets of two (26 and 12 or 20 and 12) and not individually. Urecity offered to refund me the difference for purchasing both bundles of two, and I still was able to keep the extra 12” bag. The 26” got here first, and my first impression was that it is smaller (more narrow) than I expected. It does seem like the size is more suitable for children, but vintage-style suitcases/trunks ARE smaller than the modern style of luggage. I fell in love with the historical map design, and I could not find any other suitcases this classy and appealing with a similar design. I debated on returning them because of the small size, but I have decided to keep them because they are so unique and stylish. The dust covers and clear bag protectors are luxe. I plan to travel with them later this month, and I will update this review with more photos and maybe some video footage of how much I was able to fit in them and how they’ve held up. I plan to check the 26 and carry on the 20 and one 12. The bags look so much bigger in this photo than in person. If they were able to make the top of each bag as deep as the bottom for extra packing space, they would be five stars in my book. I’m crossing my fingers that they hold up on my trip. I may purchase some compression packing cubes.**POST TRAVEL UPDATE** I ended up returning the entire set because I decided that they weren’t for me. They were just too small for my needs. I had to pack everything carefully to make it fit. They did survive being checked for a round trip with a layover going both ways. I ended up checking the carry-on and the 26” and I didn’t have any issues. The only damage was to the clear protective case. One corner of the plastic got ripped, but better that than the bag itself. The bags got a lot of compliments and looks. They are indeed beautiful bags, but they are not something you want to buy to pack a lot of clothing and shoes. I’d probably consider a carry-on size as a makeup bag or something. If only they could increase volume of the bag! The company has superb customer service. I really wanted these to work. I hope my review helps.",

    "reviewText": "When I saw this design and the vintage trunk look, I had to have it. I got so many compliments walking through the airport because it's just that gorgeous. I love that both pieces came in its own dust bag for storage. And then there is the clear luggage cover that goes over the carry on which was also a plus. I normally buy luggage covers for my bags but since this had a really cool design I didn't want to cover it. I did use it as a carry on and did not check it because I know how the airlines are and I did not want them to damage my bag. So I cannot attest to the durability of it as checked piece but I would never check this, ever. The wheels roll smoothly and its quite spacious for a carryon. Hope this helps.",

    "reviewText": "These look even better in person. Aesthetically pleasing. Smooth hard case cover that is also flexible. The wheels spin so smooth and I LOVE the inside zipper that organizes the top half. This is perfect for the whole family on vacation. Took it on a ten day vacation internationally and its so easy to roll through the airport. Packed for a family of four in these and even my 3 year old was able to push them through the airport. Definitely recommend. I didn't give them five starts because I don't love the TSA locks. They are so cute tho!",

The color is a bit lighter than expected, but I really like it!! I used the med sized bag for my trip, it held everything i needed and rolled great! Unfortunately the durability just isn't there. I had a direct flight (only 1.5 hours) and when I picked up my bag, it was already damaged. There is a hole and a couple gouges. I didn't expect it to be perfect, but this seems like alot for such a short trip!! I couldn't imagine what would have happened on a long haul, or if this was on/off loaded multiple times. I understand now, why quality luggage is much more expensive. You definitely get what you pay for!",

This set was a little bit pricier but when they came, it really felt worth it. Looks *just* like the pictures. I was really excited for the vintage feel of it while still being a little modern and dreamy and I was super pleased with everything! I was also prepared for it to feel low quality but it honestly feels very sturdy, and they come with plastic protectors to keep it from getting dirty or scratched when checking bags. The locks are very secure as well which I love. The checked bag isn’t huge but it’s definitely bigger than carry-ons are allowed to be. I’m super excited to use these!",

If you are used to stuffing luggage full, sitting on top and squeezing the zipper closed, then this is not the luggage for you, or buy compression packing bags to go with it. But it is really cute.",

I was concerned about it opening during flight but the latches are very sturdy and do not come apart. Please note that I have not taken these on a flight yet so I can’t speak to the durability on flights, but I feel confident with it. I will definitely use the plastic covering they give though.Things to consider:- They have no give so overpacking won’t be an option with these.- The 12in one is more like a purse. Still super cute but you can’t fit a ton in there.- The 26in one is fairly thin compared to other luggage so if you’re looking for big luggage or taking a long trip, you may need to find something bigger.- This is more of a “form over function” kind of set.",

I was able to get quite a bit in the smallest, I will be using the other two during the summer. The lilac is bright, I used it a a carry-on but would have had no trouble finding on the carousel.cons: I could not fully extend the handle on the small case because it got a bit wobbly fully extended. However, it did work way better extended only part way, seemed to be a lot more stable that way.",

I’ve had to charge these 5 times in the time I’ve had them. The only poopy thing about them is how sensitive the touch button can be. As a lady with long hair, sometimes my hair touches the earbuds and messes with the volume. Other instances with the volume is when I take an earbud out to listen to someone in the office, I’ll put the earbud back in and the volume is cranked all the way. #annoying #blastedmyear",

They're cute and nobody I know will mistake them for theirs if they're just sitting outside the case. Sound quality is good, sometimes I have to turn my phone up a little bit more but it's not that big of an issue. Battery life is less than the TOZO brand I had last but not by much. Considering I wear an earbud pretty consistently listening to audiobooks changing out the earbud once... sometimes twice a day... isn't a bad trade off. Case has to be charged once or twice a week.",

(I saw a few reviews saying one didn’t work maybe that’s why) I like to wear one at a time so I can swap, my old ones would last 2 hours max. When I got these I put one in at 3o’clock and at 8 o’clock battery was still around half to around 3/4 full.Just one edit: still love them but the controls on the buds are very sensitive. An example I was hugging my Fiancée and the volume on what I was watching started getting louder and louder.",

    "reviewText": "These are a decent pair of earbuds. I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality is what I would also describe as decent. I've had better, the base that I typically like is lacking a bit, but I've also had much worse, the sound is full enough to make for a nice enough listening experience. The fact that this comes as a 2 pack is so satisfying. For me, It's always a countdown when I get headphones like these till one goes missing. It's nice to have a backup pair. For the price of these especially when you account for the fact that these are both separately under 15 bucks, I was pleasantly surprised that they had touch controls. The only thing I don't like is that they sometimes don't sit in the ear well. Sometimes when I fidget with it a little I'll find a nice snug position. If you need a couple of emergency pair or just aren't too picky and want some cheap, but totally acceptable earbuds, I say go for these.",

    "reviewText": "To be honest, I purchased these wireless headphones for the cuteness factor. I wanted a pair of headphones to use while I am working at home but not connected by a wire so I wouldn't have to keep taking them off and on while getting up and walking away from my desk. How awesome is the case???!!!I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I have listened to enough music through headphones dating back all the way to the 2nd Sony Walkman WM-2 from 1981. Sound is relative and specific to each individual's ears. For me, I know what I like in a pair of headphones, crisp highs and full bodied sound. Not heavy bass that sounds muffled and distorted or tinny trebles. While these headphones won't compare to a top of the line Sennheisers, Sony or Bose, for the price point and the novelty - you get so much MORE than your money's worth. The sound is full bodied and so much clearer than any of the headphones in my collection.It feels like I am hearing so much more and picking up on nuances in the songs I have listened to for years, that I haven't heard before. I am hearing my music in a whole new way. :)They fit so well and are so comfortable, almost like they were made for my ears specifically. They fit as well in my ears as they do in the case. I forget they are on my ears. The range works well too, I can walk downstairs into my kitchen while connected to music at my desk in my bedroom and there is no stuttering of connection nor does it skip a beat.The instructions are ok, but doesn't explain what it means when the devil on the earbud turns blue when it's NOT pairing.I bought another pair for my daughter and am considering getting another pair as a backup.",

    "reviewText": "I love the design of these headphones and the convenience of them. They do connect well to Bluetooth and the sound quality is good for the money! The battery life seems good but not sure yet. they seemed to have lasted longer enough for me to do my chores. I love that you can charge the earbuds inside of the animal themed case. And then the case you can charge with a USB plug that it comes with. It's very kawaii. The milk cat is adorable. The only thing I will complain about is they're not the easiest to use once they're in, bc they're touch activated on each side of the earbuds and sometimes when I'm just trying to shove the earbud back into my ear if I am bending down to clean and stuff it pauses the music or changes the volume and I'm like ahhh esp bc my phone isn't right there in my pocket haha. I guess I'm getting used to them and may have to use bigger earhole dudes or the little rubber protectors that go into your ear on the earbuds. It comes with those in different sizes which is nice. I'll probably have to switch to the bigger ones. But overall they're worth the money for wireless ear buds. I don't have the money to spend on apple airpods right now. These were an excellent solution and like I said the design is so cute. We'll see how long they last!!",

    "reviewTitle": "Überraschend gut!",
    "reviewText": "Als erstes: Ich muss zugeben, dass ich mich vom Design hab locken lassen. Daher waren meine Erwartungen nicht sehr hoch.Ich wurde aber mehr als positiv überrascht. Schon beim auspacken bekommt man das Gefühl von Qualität. Das Design ist unschlagbar, aber auch die Verarbeitung ist gut gelungen, überhaupt nicht klapprig oder unhandlich.Die Ladedose ist etwas groß, aber passt trotzdem in jede Jackentasche und ist ein lustiger Handschmeichler. Die Buds an sich paaren sich schnell und reagieren sofort auf die touch-Sensoren. Die sind zwar etwas hinderlich, wenn man die Earbuds zurecht rücken möchte, aber man gewöhnt sich schnell dran und kann dementsprechend umgreifen.Halten tuen sie in den Ohren gut und haben einen hohen Tragekomfort. Nur der rechte sitzt etwas lockerer und muss hin und wieder korrigiert werden, das kann aber auch an meinen Ohren liegen.Eher ungeeignet sind die buds aber zum entspannen oder einschlafen, da sie im liegen auf der Seite drücken und schnell weh tun.Die Soundqualität ist sehr gut, auf jeden Fall ausreichend für Rock, Metal, Elektro, EBM und Rap. Zu klassischer Musik etc. kann ich nichts sagen. Besonders ist, meiner Meinung nach, die mögliche Lautstärke. Die Kopfhörer haben selber die Möglichkeit, Lautstärke zu regulieren und das sehr hoch. Sind die Earbuds auf das maximale, brauch ich mein Handy nur halb so laut ein zu stellen. Beides auf maximum ist unaushaltbar laut. Kenne ich von anderen Bluetooth anders. Auch nur in dem Fall, hört man in der Umwelt etwas von der Musik.Andererseits, mit den Buds im Ohr ist man ungestört von Außenveräuschen, diese werden aber nicht voll unterdrückt. Also wichtige sachen, wie Sirenen oder rufen erreichen einen trotzdem.Zum eingebauten Mikrophon kann ich auch nur gutes sagen. Stimmen werden klar und deutlich aufgenommen, Hintergrundgeräusche stören kaum.Die Buds sind eigentlich normal bis \"etwas\" groß. Ich habe relativ kleine Ohren und die Earbuds dürften nicht größer sein. Daher würde ich eher sagen, dass sie nicht für Kinder geeignet sind.Zusammen gefasst: eine klare Kaufempfehlung!",

    "reviewText": "First of all, I was shocked to find out these were officially licensed Minecraft earbuds! I received them through the Amazon Vine Reviews Program and that's kind of a rarity in terms of review items, so that was pretty cool! I really like the creeper look (and I think it was a good idea to stick with just two colors and forego the additional shading to give them an overall cleaner look earbuds-wise).As earbuds, they work great! They actually DO go up in volume to a fairly high level - your phone just WARNS you about it sooner. So, as an adult, I can just go \"pfft. Okay. Thanks.\" and crank it on up to a normal (or, dare I say, loud) level... but I'll get an alert at about the 2/4 volume mark instead of the 3/4 volume mark, if that makes sense. In other words: if you're buying these for an actual child, you'll still need to supervise their usage and/or actually parent them and explain volume control and why it's important.They come with three different sizes of ear tips, they create a really good seal (they block out so much outside noise!!), and the battery life is incredible. These are great!",

    "reviewText": "I’ve never seen anything like these earbuds. The case is open, and the earbuds sit flush inside. It‘s a singular situation where one will 100% 1.) Look cool and 2.) Lose their earbuds.You must charge them before using. One must also simultaneously press both earbuds at the same time for 3 seconds to turn on. One can press only 1 earbud for 3 seconds to turn off. I can tap them to pause. When I tap them again, they don’t turn back on. That’s frustrating. I am not even going to try to adjust the volume via the earbud. When I put them in the case and take them back out, they immediately start playing what I was just listening to. That’s cool.When I take them out of my ears, I take pictures, and do all sorts of things in any app that’s open at the time. It’s hard to control the buttons while just holding them or placing them somewhere.I like that three sizes of rubber ear tips come included. I took the largest size. They fit in my ears well. The case shows how much charge the earbuds/case has. The light turns off when it’s fully charged. When it’s charging, it blinks. More blinks means it has more charge. Less blinks, less charge. I took a picture of this described in the directions.For the novelty, these are cool. I’m taking them traveling with me. Wish me luck I don’t lose them.",

    "reviewText": "The only reason I could see these being for children is that they do not go very loud. Which is fine and with the great noise suppression and amazing sound quality the high volume isn't needed! So if you are a Guardians fan or in the market for wireless ear buds, these will do just fine! I love the case design, different than most sealed cases is kind of a nice \"breath of fresh air\". I have had no issues other than initial pairing. I was impatient and connected to both earbuds separately when I should have let them connect to each other first. It didn't take long, I am just quick on the trigger. LolFitment is comfortable out of the box, but comes with different tips if needed.Touch controls work well.I did notice that if I covered my ears the noise canceling would cancel out my music so it definitely works!Call clarity seemed decent on both ends.I did not test maximum battery life but did use for a few hours at maximum volume and still had 60% battery remaining.",

    "reviewText": "Recently, my daughter needed some new wireless earbuds, and I was not going to shell out for another high priced piece of fruit. That being said, I was searching Amazon, and came across these guardians of the galaxy earbuds.I don’t know about you, but I love comic books. I pick these up on a whim, hoping that my daughter would like them, but secretly, hoping that she would hate them, so I could keep them myself. Sure enough, she wanted plain white ones, and I got to keep these designer, guardian headphones. Dad win!That being said, the headphones charge up in an hour or two, and we easily give you 5 to 6 hours of consistent use before needing to be charged. They look stylish and fit well in the ears, however, the case feels a little cheap, and I don’t like the holes that the earbuds stick out of. I prefer a completely enclosed case.Overall, the price point was pretty good, and the earbuds seem to be a quality. The sound is decent and on par with all of the other $30 earbuds I’ve purchased in the past.",

In my ears they fit perfectly fine and sealed nicely.The sound quality is pretty good for a set of buds that are under 30 dollars, The highs were fairly clear but had some distortion on the top end, the mids were a bit muddy and the lows lacked any real punch but this was what I had expected given the price.Overall given the price, the design, and the features this is a solid 5 star product",

I bought a pair for my daughter who also loves them. They are not noise cancelling (which is fine for me). I just had to order another pair because the magnet that holds the case together shifted so now it doesn’t stay closed. Another issue was the metal charging port on the buds would get pushed too far inside that it wouldn’t make a solid connection when charging. I just opened them up and put some foam in to hold it in place and it works just fine!For a $25 pair to last me 2 years definitely exceeded my expectations.",

Many are complaining about the battery life, but I have only charged it once so far. I haven’t used it in a few weeks, and the buds are still charged. They’re deff worth the money if you're looking for something that is affordable and has some quality. I already own bose and beats headphones, so I understand the difference in sound quality. But for the price I paid for these, the sound quality is not bad. Also, I hate in-ear headphones because i have small ears and these are great. my ears don't hurt after using them for a while. Hope this helps!!",

I plan on buying two more for my kiddos eventually, and am excited to see how the other color options hold up. The sound is great, it's very easy to use, holds a charge pretty well, and charges easily inside the cute magnetic base. I really love how portable this is, so it mostly stays in my car's console for whenever I need it. Works well for the kids too, and I'm so glad it came with adjustable earbuds. Hopefully this stays at the very fair price, because I'd say it's worth it for that.",

    "reviewText": "DONT BUY THESE!Just got them today, havent had the chance to use them yet. Earbud case wasnt even secure in box and rattleing around and case's hinge is very loose and doesnt seem stable at all. Very flimsy feeling. Not to sure about quality of item.EDIT: Ive used them now. Not comfortable for \"small\" ears like many reviews say and the plastic on the outside of the earbuds is cheap and sharp in some places, so it can catch on your ear when putting them in and pulling them out. I dont use the ear plug things cause they wont fit my ears if they are attached, and even without them they are a bit to big for my ears and have fallen out due to that reason.They do not work properaly, as if you walk more than 10 feet way from your device(or through a door/another floor) they will start to static, and then the one further from the device will turn off while the closer one cuts out here and there. And if you go more than that they will disconnect and wont auto reconnect without maunally going in and connecting them. Shoot ive had them cut out in the same room at work and it wasnt that big of a room.When first connected (everytime) they automatically turn it up full volume or \"maximum volume\" as it will say so watch for that. And if you even slightly touch them they will either turn off the music, or turn up the volume. Not that the max volume is even that loud. And if you tap them again they wont do anything, no matter how long you wait or how many times you tap them again.Sound wise they are NOT noise cancelling, and very echo-ey. I used them at work(i work in a factory) and i could still hear all my co-workers over my music with one earbud in. i also used them while powerwashing my house (with both earbuds in) and not only was my washer louder than the loudest i could turn up the volume but my neighbor could still talk over both my earbuds and my powerwasher, and he was just talking in a normal tone.Needless to say i dont know why it has all these 5 star reviews (unless they were paid reviews) none of the things worked properally for me and all the reviews deceived me into thinking this was a good product. I might as well have paid a dollar more for the other earbuds i previously had.",

I bought it because has such a cute design, the earphones fit snug in my ear and are overall comfortable, noise canceling as well.After maybe almost a month or so using it, the right side just suddenly… stopped working?It works well when you use it but putting it back in its charging case is the problem. The magnet seems to just be rejecting it and the connection keeps interfering with other Bluetooth devices even though I disconnected it several times; I had to “forget device” in order for it to stop completely. I’ve wiped it clean, I tried to press it back in place, I just don’t know what to do at this point.If you want to buy simple, inexpensive Bluetooth earphones, might I suggest not getting these. For sound quality, go for it. Otherwise, don’t.",

    "reviewText": "The charging case lid had broken notches, the charging case smells burnt, and the earbuds produce no sound.I bought these Lilo and Stitch Bluetooth headphones with great excitement, as they were a special gift for my daughter, who is a big fan of the movie. However, the experience was completely disappointing from the moment I opened the package. When I took them out, I noticed that the box was broken and visibly damaged, as if it had suffered several impacts during shipping. Not only was it deformed, but it also looked like it had been handled carelessly.The product’s presentation is an important part, especially when it’s a gift, and this damaged box completely took away the charm. I couldn’t even give it to my daughter with the excitement I had hoped for. I also had to spend time looking for a last-minute alternative so she wouldn’t be disappointed. I believe that a product aimed at children and presented as an \"ideal gift\" should have better protection to avoid these kinds of issues.Please consider improving the packaging or taking additional precautions in shipping. I would not recommend this product if you plan to give it as a gift; the risk of receiving it in poor condition is very high and ends up ruining the experience.",

The right side is very low, I’ve cleaned it but it was rarely used because she used one side only. The left is not going on, doesn’t indicate if it’s charging and no sound is coming out. I’ve watched the video for troubleshooting but nothing complies to our situation. I know It’s been a long time but Im trying to connected to the company but there is no site to help. I just want to know what I can do to fix the problem. If they only last this long then that would really suck.",

    "reviewText": "I was drawn in by the photos that showed the Fanta can-sized case, but it turns out that picture must have been photoshopped. I was expecting something the size of a mini Coke can, which would’ve been perfect for my car's cup holder. Unfortunately, the case is much smaller than that, which was a letdown.As for the earbuds themselves, they work fine, about what you’d expect for this price range, but they’re not exactly premium quality. The case is cute, and it comes with a very short USB-A to USB-C charging cable, instructions, and the earbuds themselves. They start charging as soon as you put them in the case, and they don’t take too long to power up, which is nice. The soda can case has a USB-C port with a rubber cover and an indicator LED to show the charging status.The touch controls on the earbuds are simple—one tap to play/pause, double tap on the right to increase volume, and double tap on the left to lower it. They fit snugly in my ears and don’t fall out, but don’t expect any sound isolation.All in all, the product photos were a bit misleading, and I feel a bit tricked. If I had known the real size and quality, I wouldn’t have bought them.",

    "reviewText": "This pair of diet coke earbuds has ups and downs.The earbuds comes in a branded box as shown in my first picture with the soda can charging case, pair of earbuds, instructions/information paper, and a very very short USB-A to USB-C charging cable.When you put them in the charging case they immediately start charging and don't take terribly long to charge. I haven't used them a ton but that will come in my downsides. The top of the soda can has a USB-C charging port covered with a rubber cover and it also has a indicator led next to it to show if it is charging or finished.There are touch controls on the ear buds, such as tap once to play/pause, double tap on the right to turn the volume up and double tap the left to turn it down.The earbuds actually fit and stay very well in my ears without coming loose but there is no sound isolation or anything on these.Moving to the downsides, as I just mentioned there is no sound isolation or seal that this forms in your ear so you will hear everything around you and if you have these loud enough, anyone around can probably hear what you are listening to as well. That also brings me to the sound quality, it's just not great. Using a 20$ \"gaming\" headset produced better clearer sound with more bass than these could produce. I also noticed a few milliseconds of delay between what I see and hear if I connected them to a computer.The soda can isn't the easiest to open to put these back in for charging. There is little to nowhere to grab and because the magnets are good, it stays sealed.For some reason when you use these earbuds via Bluetooth, they ALWAYS are flashing blue on each ear bud to signify they are connected.Overall, not the best headphones but they are official and even in the bluetooth list they show up as \"diet coke earbuds\" which to me is fantastic so I know what I'm connecting to. The sound quality just isn't the best, the soda can isn't the easiest to open, and the constant flashing blue lights on the earbuds isn't great either. However, they do fit my ears very well, the touch/tap controls work as they should, and they last a decent amount of time just listening to music and other audio.",

    "reviewText": "There is a picture where they detail the measurements in millimeters, and in that same picture they show the can in someone’s hand but it must be photoshopped because I got the sense these were the size of a coke mini can. That was kind of what I was hoping for; not that the earbuds would be ginormous, but that the case, sitting in my cars cup holder could be mistaken for a coke. These are too small for that.Otherwise, they work fine. They’re as good as anything in this price point but not much bigger than other earbud cases.While the words didn’t technically lie, I find this product page a bit misleading based on the photoshopped product shots. I’ll own my part in falling for it, but is that how you want to buy products? Knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t buy again.My rating system breakdown:1 Star = Safety hazard, gross misrepresentation of product, or flat out doesn't work2 Stars = Needs improvement3 Stars = Meh, likely wouldn't buy again.4 Stars = Meets expectations5 Stars = Exceeds expectations",

    "reviewText": "These earbuds are fantastic for the price (this is for two sets, red and blue). My 7 and 10 year olds are huge Pokemon fans, so they flipped when they saw these! The cases are shaped like Pokeballs, and are so cute. They charge via USB C, and connect via Bluetooth. My 10 year old was able to pair them with her Chromebook without any help. The sound quality is about what I expected, but these earbuds are nice and loud, so my kids didn't care. The battery life could be better, and that was the main complaint I heard about these earbuds from my children.Overall, these are cute, functional earbuds that my kids love, and would make a great gift for any Pokemon fan.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very good at a low price point. Great bluetooth range.",
    "reviewText": "Obviously these are not high-end studio headphones. But for low-end earbuds, they are pretty good. They are certainly louder than other similarly-priced earbuds, which is good because some brands are so quiet that you have trouble hearing on a plane, for example. Also, the bluetooth worked flawlessly over 30 feet away, which was very good, and better than many products that cost over twice as much. That's convenient if you want to walk around a large room and just leave your phone or PC where it is and not have to move it.The rubber covers on the earbuds fit well enough, although other brands are tighter. There is another set of differently-shaped rubber covers, which is a nice touch, but they appear to be for even smaller ears, so I didn't try them. It also comes with a USB charging cable (without the AC wall plug) and also pairing instructions which were very easy to follow but with tiny writing. Please manufacturers, try to make writing in a larger font for people with poor eyesight.The sound quality was mixed. For piano and acapella female voice, they are quite good. That higher end of the range is pretty exceptional, to be honest. But, as with most cheaper earbuds, the sound quality goes down as they get into lower sounds like bass. These do seem to be bass-boosted, which is nice but also leaves a \"hole\" at the lower midrange. But again, bass boosted seems better than not bass boosted at this price point.The charging pods are cute and seem to work well. And you get two sets, good for two kids to each have their own identical ones with a different color so there is no fighting. As a parent of two kids, this is very important.All in all, this is a very good product for the lower end.",

    "reviewText": "I got these earbuds, not for kids, but for my husband and myself. My husband is clearly more of a tech user than I am and has been trying out these earbuds for awhile now (whereas I just don't like having things in my ears, these are no exception, and I find them quite uncomfortable).Observations from my husband:He likes having a USB-C port (others he has had recently had an older USB format)The strap adds versatility and the fairly compact size makes carrying along easierNot a secure fit in the ears (I will second this)When compared to other earbuds, it has more treble and less bass sound than many--will depend on how you use them as to whether this is a plus or minusThe case has the feel and function like it won't last longThe print on the instructions is too small for many people to read. He had to use his phone's magnifier to read it. The instructions need to refer to the same item consistently by the same name. For example, the \"headset power box\" is also referred to as a bin and a compartmentThe function button is too easy to touch and be activated when the earbuds are put in the ears. The button also doesn't always do what is expected. One short touch typically powers off the earbud rather than pause what one is listening to",
