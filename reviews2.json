    "reviewText": "I like the design. Ambivalent about the light. Could use a few more stones, but then it's fun to find and place my own. Only issues I have noted are that the tube isn't quite long enough for the pump to rest on the bottom of the bowl. Not a big deal - just keep the water level up. Gets noisier when water is too low so you can tell it's time to add water. One time it didn't turn on. I emptied and cleaned it and added fresh water and it was fine. My wife could easily make something like this from pottery, then I could add my own pump and have another (definitely more costly that way, but it would be a gift with meaning).",

    "reviewText": "Don't buy this fountain unless you want water all over your desk. I turned the apump all the way down and it wouldn't pump the water...turned it up one more notch, still nothing...one more and it pours the water on the very edge of the bowl, causing it to pour out. Before you ask, yes, the surface it was on is level. I literally got out a level and checked. I also made sure that it was assembled correctly and the cord were coming out of the slot provided, which they were. So this should not be happening. I did end up putting two popsicle sticks stacked on top of each other under the one side just to get the water to land in the bowl evenly.Another thing to note is that it only came with enough rocks to cover half of the base.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Lovely design, sturdy, easy to maintain",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have to say that I am impressed by this fountain. This fountain was purchased to replace a cheaper one that didn't last long. I am using it as both a decoration and a cat fountain for my spoiled cats.Look: The material the base is made from doesn't look spectacular or stand out as a centerpiece but it's passable. I prefer how it looks without the light plugged in, as it has a simple elegance. The water does pour from each of the four spouts evenly and I added a slab of green goldstone at the base to change the sound and add some glimmer. I had been hoping the base would be open to be filled with stones but it is solid. That was a downfall at first until I realized how helpful that would be for maintenance, since it keeps out the cat hair and other debris that the previous fountain accumulated.Sound: It's loud enough with the goldstone that I can hear the tinkle in the next room with the heater on. Without the goldstone it's pretty quiet but it comes with some pebbles that you can place on the wire at the top of the base to catch the water and make it louder.Pump: Water pressure is good and the pump is the same type of pump I've seen in every other fountain, so cleaning it is a breeze. It plugs into a pretty tight tube which keeps the pressure straight up to the ball part. Without the ball there, the pressure is high enough to make a bit of a mess so turn it off before you clean it!Power: There is no on/off switch, so you have to unplug it. However, for the lights, you can simply unplug the lights from the pump. They otherwise join for the main power source and there's only one plug required for the whole fountain, which was a concern I had had before purchase since I only have enough room for one outlet.Lights: When the lights are on, it is ridiculously fun to watch but also sort of tacky. It has three colored lights below the ball: red, blue, and green. When they are lit, it looks sort of like a disco ball. I hope to add a video of this. Also, the wiring for the lights seems safer than some fountains and I doubt I would damage the wiring during regular maintenance, as has happened on some fountains with lights. Plus, the lights can be unplugged from the power supply. As far as safety, that's a plus!Ball: The ball, on its own, is really nothing special. I dropped it while taking it out of the box and it survived, so that's good. I did notice once that it had stopped spinning, though when I pushed it, the ball began and sped right back up.Maintenance: Pretty standard care for fountains. Use distilled water if you can. The hardest spots to clean are the tube and pump. If you've cleaned pumps before, it's no different. The tube is short enough that cotton swabs should be sufficient. I haven't had it long enough to see how it reacts to mineral buildup but I imagine it won't look so elegant due to the dark color but the water is also fairly limited to a couple areas, not all of which are visible, so I'm not worried.Splash: None!! Previous fountains have left messes from splashes but this one, as long as the ball is in place, does not splash outside of the fountain!Price: It is a bit expensive for a table fountain but well worth it as long as it lasts. The price is actually comparable to cat fountains but this looks better and is just as simple to clean and does not require filters. The bigger cost is ongoing distilled water.Overall: This fountain seems sturdy and simple. I like the sound and it's easy to adjust the sound when I get sick of it. The light is pretty great for when kids visit or when I need sensory regulation but I otherwise leave it unplugged.I will probably purchase another in a month or two for the other side of the counter. If you're on the fence between this and one of the cheaper fountains, go with this fountain. It'll last longer.EDIT: Added a short video just so you can see what it looks like with light and without the light, as well as seeing it from multiple angles.Another edit to add that I've found maintenance to be very easy and actually, any lime buildup it may be getting doesn't seem to be very noticeable, though I am using distilled water for the most part. My cat loves it and drinks off of the ball part, which is adorable. If I knew how to upload a second video, I would!",

However, after 10 minutes it quit. I thought it may be the outlet so tried 2 other outlets (disbelieving that it would quit after 10 minutes).I took it apart and put it back together again, per instructions. Nothing. Did it again. Nothing. So basically, I spent money for 10 minutes of AWW, 20 minutes of being perplexed and now angry that I will have to pack and go to UPS store to mail back.I took this picture at this angle to show it was plugged in!Note: I'd give zero stars if possible.",

I like it so much, I will be purchasing another one for my home It is well made. When you see the ball that looks cracked, be aware that this is the way it is designed so that it can reflect the colors more. It is a great piece.This is an update to the second fountain that I purchased. This one did not perform like the first one. The ball wouldn't spin unless the fountain pump was turned up on high, and when that happened, it splashed water all over the place. Thus, I will be returning this fountain for a credit.",

    "reviewText": "This tabletop fountain looks great on a small table or desk. It is easy to clean, and works great. I only use distilled water in the fountain, since regular tap water can leave behind mineral build-up and clog the pump. The fountain also looks great in the dark as the light dances across the surrounding walls and ceiling in multiple colors, especially shades of greens, blues, and reds. If you want an especially loud fountain, then you might look elsewhere as it is not excessively loud. It does put out enough sound, depending on how the rocks are arranged, to relax me when I'm in the same room with it running. I would definitely purchase this fountain again if I ever needed another one. Once again, I strongly recommend using only distilled water in it, and changing the water once a month to keep it performing great.",

    "reviewText": "I‚Äôve had this fountain for a few months now and really enjoy it. The noise level is pretty quiet- you can hear the water over it- but for the price it‚Äôs a good motor. Unique, pretty, and sturdy. No spills. I‚Äôve dropped it twice and nothing broke :) I like that you can put rocks and small decorations on the bottom. I even put a few stones on the leaves. I also like that you can bend them how you want them. I would definitely say it‚Äôs worth the money.The only cons are:1) paint job is complete but underside is very bronze and the green on top is a bit metallic. Not a natural look. (The positive to this is that this fountain is super easy to paint.)2) it isn‚Äôt the highest quality motor but for the price it works. I run my fountain quite a bit and it‚Äôs never failed. It doesn‚Äôt distract from the sound of the water either, just has a light hum.3) I do wish the cord was longer, but an extension cord fixes that :)Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this cute little thing. I get compliments all the time on it. Also it‚Äôs fun to get different rocks or little stone animals to decorate it!",

But some of those who said that used a rock or pebble to assist with the flow and prevent splashing. Okay, potential problem solved. Several others mentioned that the pump was loud. Again, I considered not buying. But then I read responses that said to make sure the pump is completely submerged. Okay, another potential problem solved. I didn't find any other issues mentioned (other than the water tasting bad, but I'm not buying it to drink or for an animal to drink so....) so I decided to buy it. It's lovely! It produces a wonderful visual effect. My pump speed is at the highest and it trickles nicely. Doesn't splash at all. The pump makes a light hum, but it's not annoying. It is fully submerged. It shipped quickly and was easy to set up. My only disappointment is that it does not produce sound of water I was hoping for.",

    "reviewText": "**Update**Well, it lasted me 3 years, today it died. I think the inside was clogged, even after cleaning the bowl and the base the water just trickled up to the top and barely made its way back down. Not too bad for the price honestly, I thought it would have died much sooner.**************I think this is a very nice water fountain for the price. I followed the recommendation of some other reviewers and added river stones to the base. It just enhances the look. I also made sure to suction the pump to the bottom of the base before adding water, and I have the pump set on the lowest setting. I have no issues with splashing, vibrations, or sounds from the pump. It really does need to be filled all the way to the top of the bowl to keep the pump completely submerged. I have it set on my desk at work, on a fake stone pad. Even after running it all week, 8 hours per day, I have not yet needed to fill it with water. I think if you fill it properly and set it on a base, you should not have any problems with vibration of the motor or any unnecessary sounds. This fountain is silent and very pretty.",

    "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Careful buying used, good condition with minor imperfections. They are major. Craftsmanship also not consistent between buyers.",
    "reviewText": "UPDATE 2: I had to come back and lower my rating to 1 star. This is ridiculous. We've all seen the $9.99 table fountains at Walgreens that are cheaply made and don't seem to last. But at least they don't splatter all over. This fountain is no better and just as cheaply made. It's motor is exactly the same as a $10 fountain too. I am so sick of the splatters this fountain leaves all over my table every time I use this. I posted another picture to show you what happens after just three minutes of use. It's cheaply made and I would expect a LOT more paying 4 times the price. This is worth no more than $10, and had it been priced where it belongs, it would have gotten 3-4 stars. If you get what you pay for then this fountain is a scam.ORIGINAL REVIEW: (Update #1 is after this.) I hope to return and update this review to 5 stars. Beware buying ‚Äúused‚Äù with only minor imperfections. The one I received had MAJOR imperfections making the fountain completely unusable. Ever. I‚Äôve included pictures. Compared to the other reviewer pictures, you can see the drastic difference. Mine had the fountain top leaves installed way too close to the front edge where the water is supposed to spill off onto the base/rocks. Mine spills right onto the flared edge and splashes the water all over the table. Ironically, I purchased this fountain to replace another defective one I bought at the store, which splashed water everywhere but into the reservoir. It also had a defective bottom on the inside reservoir with a grainy finish that prevents the pump‚Äôs suction cups from adhering at all, even when moist. I used to be able to trust Good Condition to Like New, but lately everything is very poor condition to unusable, like this fountain. And I only saved a measily few dollars. Something like this one needs major repairs and resoldering to be usable, so it should be sold for 1/4 the price, honestly revealing its need to be fixed. I just reordered a new one and when I receive that I will update this review with its quality and performance.UPDATE: I received the new one just a few days later. This is brand new, not used from Amazon Warehouse. It is a little bit better, however the suction cups still do not stick properly to the bottom as the instructions require and explain how to do it. The bottom is too rough of a surface to stick, with or without wetting the suction cups. The instructions say to get rid of the vibration noises, to make sure the suction cups are adhered securely to the bottom of the reservoir. We can't, it won't stick. In addition, the hose attachment coming out of the fountain top that attaches to the pump is at an odd angle that won't let the pump sit flat, but pushes it up on one side. The hose should be straight down, perpendicular to the bottom of reservoir to control vibration, but it is not. It is at a 30 degree angle and not possible to bend/reposition. Therefore, our new fountain has a significant audible vibration sound that cannot be fixed, and can be annoying when you just want to hear the sweet sound of the running water. The fountain top leaves that pour into the rocks below (rocks not included,) are now mounted further back from the edge than the first one as my new image shows, but it is still mounted a bit too close to the edge, and after 20 minutes of use my table was significantly dotted with splashes of water all around the front and sides of the fountain extending out at least 3-4\", which annoys me. I'm going to see if my husband can unscrew the fountain top and reattach it properly, far enough away from the edge as is possible and rotated to sit all the way back near the edge opposite the lowest water leaf side. and out of the way of the pump cord - to avoid the splatters. It should not be a problem if we have a set of holes under the fountain top from the previous screwed placement. This should prevent splashing on my table, I think. If not, I will be contacting the company to complain about quality of craftsmanship not being consistent between buyers because images from other reviewers show a much better attached fountain top. Two purchases having the same problem should not happen.",

The fountain was making a slight runing water noise, but a put a rock in one of the flowers, so the noise is gone! Simple, not too much parts,not the fanciest materials, but the flower are in metal, and it's enough for me.",

The LED light appears blueish on camera (as shown in my photos as well as the product images) but the light is actually white with a cool hue.A lot of people have complained about the sound, but I do not mind it (watch the videos and judge for yourself!) You can also adjust the flow on the pump to get your ideal sound or, as other people pointed out, put a pebble or two under the streams.I was also pleasantly surprised with how fast I received the fountain. The package arrived 1 week ahead of estimated delivery date, and the packaging thoroughly protects the fountain from damage. Setup was very easy, and I love that pebbles were included with the fountain. The fountain is made of plastic which makes it very lightweight, and I don't think it takes away from the aesthetics.",

    "reviewText": "Beautiful piece sits nicely on my entry table. I am enjoying the sound of the waterfall in the house. Downfalls: I had to modify the mesh insert to make the sound pleasing to the ears; the water velocity switch really does not work...it only works on full force which impacts the sound of the water. the low does not pull the water through the pump; there is no on off switch, you must unplug it if you want it to stop. Overall, the piece is beautiful and relaxing, but there was manipulation involved to get it to work as desired.",

    "reviewText": "The fountain does need to be set on low or it is too loud. Even on the low setting, however, my particular unit splashes. I found that if I nestled a light-colored felt flower in the bottom (in this instance, a rose that I had from a hobby/craft store), it caught and soaked up the slight residue. The flower adds a very nice touch, enough of the lighting still comes through from the base, the fountain now sounds the way I want it to and it is a beautiful addition to my home!",

    "reviewText": "This fountain is beautiful. It is VERY cheaply made, which is why it's a bit confusing on the cost. There is no adjuster for the water flow, no on/off switch (you have to unplug to turn on/off), no adjuster for the led lights. It's a beautifully sculpted piece of plastic. That's it.I have another fountain that has LED's with a remote. You can utilize it as a diffuser and the remote turns the power on/off and controls the water. I paid $5 under the cost of this thing. Contemplating a return due to lack of value. My struggle - the design is poetic to me. For now, just writing a review. I'll see how annoyed I get plugging/unplugging this thing when I leave my office daily.",

Bild Nummer 1 zeigt den Brunnen mit einem Auslauf und alle anderen Bilder zeigen Brunnen mit 4 ausl√§ufen den ich auch haben wollte. Eine Anfrage beim Kundendienst wurde zeitnah beantwortet und mir wurde gesagt dass der Brunnen grunds√§tzlich 4 Ausl√§ufe hat so wie man es auch auf meinem Video sieht.Die mitgelieferten Steine sind ganz normale kieselsteine und ich habe diese mit ziersteinen ausgetauscht. Das ist aber Geschmackssache.Insgesamt kann ich diesen Brunnen weiterempfehlen und vergebe hier die volle Punktzahl.",

    "reviewText": "I'm a little disappointed with this fountain. It comes with two water flows that you can change with the switch on the pump. Keep it on the low setting because the high setting will splash water outside of the bowl. I tried it on high, adjusting water levels and position of the elephants, but it always ended up with splashing water. I filled the water to the recommended level and even placed a thin sponge in the base. This reduced the vibration sound but I continue to hear the pump rather than the sound of trickling water. The fountain does look cute. I added some rocks in the bowl to give it a nicer appearance and some weight. My clients seem to enjoy the appearance of it but I just wish that I could hear the water rather than the pump. Kind of bummed out. The seller did send the fountain in great condition and in good time. They were very quick to answer my questions and generously offered to resolve the issue.",

    "reviewText": "This fountain is a bit smaller than I'd initially thought it would be, however it is a very unique piece and I'm very happy with my purchase. It does resemble the natural stone look which makes it appealing. I did find that it must be filled completely with water up to the top as the pump requires that due to the way it sits, but it was not an issue. You just need to make sure you keep the water level up for it to properly function. I turned up the pump so it has a heavier flow of water circulating. The pump and sound of water is quiet, there is relatively no noise and not much of a water sound but enough that this piece still attracts attention as a conversation piece due to the design of it. The pump is small, I don't know how long it will last but the bowl underneath is large enough that I have another small fountain pump I believe will work if I must replace at some point. Set up was as simple as attaching the pump and filling it with water. You should be aware that there is no off switch on the cord and it has no lighting as some other fountains do. I believe those would have been attractive features to have incorporated for this fountain but I still am enjoying it anyway. It does not have an annoying water trickling sound which is nice, everyone has commented on liking the design and is surprised it is not made of stone as it appears like a heavy piece. I feel it's adequate to the price I paid and the functionality of it has been fine for a small desk sized indoor fountain. I use it in my office and I think it's a nice feature for that purpose as it doesn't leak water or splash out.",

    "reviewText": "First take was it was definitely small. But ok, still liked the design. Well, hmm, no instructions as to how the pump suctions inside the base - doesn't line up. And to stop the pump from buzzing louder than the fountain had to put stones around the pump to keep it from free floating inside the fountain (thus causing the buzz). Then, since it's so small, the water splashes out of the unit - enough that I have to place something all around the fountain to absorb the splash. Would return but as I said, like the design. Not worth the effort.",

    "reviewText": "I was looking for a little decorative fountain to give a very small indoor \"greenhouse\" some decoration. It is small....so just make sure you look at the dimensions before you buy. Also i can confirm with other reviewers that it does NOT make any \"splashing\"/water noise..... so if that's why your buying a fountain then this is not for you. Personally i think its more relaxing to watch the water, I really like the way it flows off the hand.The base is a bit plain, i would suggest putting some stones around. There was a slight vibrations, so i guess you might have to watch what you put it on?.... as of now the motor/pump is super quiet",

    "reviewText": "The first one I received was damaged and after contacting the seller a replacement was shipped before I even had a chance to drop this one off at the UPS store. The fountain pumpMakes a little noise but it is hardly noticeable. I'm using it in my chameleon terrarium and have been running it 24hrs a day 7 days a week with no problems. The flow can be adjusted with a small tab on the pump. I am using water from my well to fill it and have not had any trouble. The chameleon gets some moss and crickets in the water from time to time, this has not affected the performance and I clean the fountains water reserve every 2 weeks or so. It is made from a resin like material that will break if you drop it so be careful when moving or cleaning it. The fountain looks great and I am very happy with it. It is small but that is perfect for what I am using it for. It would look nice on a desk and not take up much space.",

The sounds are relaxing and the light is gorgeous, but it splashes and if you have hard water, it will certainly make a mess and need to be cleaned often.",

Paint isn‚Äôt metallic and really is just brown, not copper/gold like pictured. I will say that it hums, so if you‚Äôre wanting water noises this isn‚Äôt a great one for that. The marble spins and is fun to watch, the lights work great and it‚Äôs a nice display. Have to fiddler with the water pressure though. It has a dial to change the pumps strength. It had no instructions so you had to just kind of play with it to put it together just right",

This faintsin does not splutter!The sound is loud enough to be heard over relaxing music.It is affordable, light, functional and beautiful.I highly recommend it if you want to purchase a desk fountain.

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful Sound & Zen-like Elegance",
    "reviewText": "I have had numerous fountains over the years - some far more expensive than this little beauty. No fountain has had such a perfect sound as this! As you can see, it's become part of a vignette that has yet to fill in. The simplicity of this piece, as well as its rather petite size, make it perfect for such an undertaking, though it is elegant on its own.One of my favorite characteristics of this fountain is the large bowl. Even in the dry air of Tucson, I don't need to top it off more than once every three to four days. I've never run it until the motor - the blessedly silent motor - was exposed.I do add algaecide to the gallon of distilled water from which I fill it. I love that there are no mineral spots nor any sign of algae after a solid month of running. I'm only halfway through the gallon from which I filled the fountain! I mention this because it's rather astounding that I've run it for a month and have any of the original gallon jug left, let alone a full half!But what matters most about any fountain? The sound. With this fountain, its beautifully variable tones do not fight with a noisy motor for dominance. The provided motor is silent. This is also a first for me!Whether you incorporate this fountain into a larger design, place it on an altar, or run it on your office desk, you will hear nothing but the water. The design is elegant. The materials and components are high quality. I cannot imagine being disappointed by this small fountain, as long as you're aware of the size.The only thing I would add would be an inline switch to the electrical cord for convenience. But really, once you plug it in, you'll only want to stop it for cleaning, which is a breeze.I hesitated on this one simply because I had so many bad experiences with fountains in the past. This had brought nothing but joy!Some of the plants and the peacock feathers were purchased from Amazon as well.Enjoy!",

    "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Just a tad complicated",
    "reviewText": "At first I thought this was the easiest, low maintenance fountain I have gotten since normally the rest are quite an ordeal to acomodare and clean. This one is quite simple in that aspect. HOWEVER, set up was not easy and you‚Äôll have to tinker with it ALOT every time you need to clean or move anyting around to get the motor to silence. It will not be enough to just fully cover with water.The tube that came is super hard and long so you will have a terrible time cutting it until it‚Äôs exactly perfect. Don‚Äôt do it all at once because if you cut it too short it‚Äôs done. The tube is way too small for the connector so you will do quite a bit of struggling and I can definitely see how most people never get it in. Once I did I couldn‚Äôt get it out. So now it‚Äôs too long and since it‚Äôs so hard and won‚Äôt sit upright suction-cupped to the bottom as it‚Äôs meant to but instead sideways.Even when completely submerged the motor makes sound that‚Äôs louder than the splashing water so you need to continuously tinker with it and move it around until you get it to stop making noise. Unfortunately with other systems I‚Äôve had when this happens eventually there will come a time the noise won‚Äôt stop.I love the design and simplicity of this style. My concern is how long with it function accordingly.We shall see!",

I did notice what looked to be a crack repair line on it which could‚Äôve been the source of the leak. I even tried a different pump and the same thing happened over the course of a few hours.

    "reviewText": "I've wanted a tabletop fountain for a long time, but every one I tried seemed to spit water all over the place and get yucky water. So I really did my research before buying this one. The reviews said it does not spit water, and it doesn't. It has a nice flow from one level to another. It arrived in a box in a box arrangement, packed well in styrofoam. It was heavier than I expected. It looks like cheap plastic from the pics, which I didn't like, but the actual fountain really does look like granite, and looks and feels substantial. There is a warning sheet inside for electrical safety but no instructions on how to put together. The middle bowl has a square peg on the bottom that slides into the bottom bowl, the top then slides down over that. The pump has to be placed under the middle bowl, using the suction feet to stick to the bottom. Place the tube from the top bowls over the peg on the pump. Then make sure you fill with water over the pump. I added a drop of Fountec to the clean water to avoid the slimes. It makes a lovely flowing water noise straight from the box, no need to add rocks, etc. The pump is extremely quiet. I love to sleep to the sound of the flowing water, and my houseplants like having the extra humidity. I'm very happy with purchase and would recommend to others.(If your fountain splashes, try moving the switch on the side of the pump to a slower flow. I have mine on the lowest setting.)",

    "reviewText": "This fountain is VERY cheaply made. The pieces that stack on top of one another do not fit together well and mine has always leaked. The I tried putting support pieces, gluing, balancing, nothing has really worked and the top tips water out the wrong side and misses the bowl. The finish is cheap and has peeled off almost completely and I could easily peel it totally off if I tried. It doesn't really look that great either. It looks like rock from the picture but it just badly speckled. I added river rocks to mine, which helped with the look and sound of the fountain. It sort of sounds like a toilet flushing if you leave it as is. I would spend the extra couple of bucks and buy a better fountain.",

    "reviewText": "I got this to replace the \"River Bend\" fountain I had in my office, which doesn't seem to be available any more. The River Bend had 3 broad lips for the water to fall over, so it produced a very pretty, soft waterfall/rainfall noise if you scattered pebbles across the lips.This bowl fountain has 3 narrow spillways. The first two are so close to the bowls that they produce no sound at all. The third sounds like a faucet running or, like one client said \"an old guy taking a leak\". I've put some strategic blockages in the spillways and managed to get a fairly decent sound -- one I can live with, anyway -- but nothing as pretty as the Riverbend.The fountain is quite sturdily built and easy to assemble, and I've had no problems with splashing or spillover.",

    "reviewText": "I've had this fountain for about 8 days now. First - as reported - the bowls/pots are made out of some kind of porcelain or clay and the fountain is heavy.Assembly is a snap. The top two bowls are a single piece with a molded stem that fits into the 3rd bowl; and then the 3rd bowl has a molded stem that fits into the bottom bowl. The water hose from the pump to the top bowl is fed through the same stems. Another poster reported that the mounting was flimsy, but I disagree. Actually the stems are very sturdy - to the point to where the bowls will only fit in the one position as shown, and have absolutely no wobble.The sound of the water trickling is the best (loudest) of any table fountain that I've owned, which I expected with the large bottom bowl of water for the water to fall into. As others have mentioned, you don't hear the pump running at all.I was a bit concerned about the water level in the 3rd-from-top bowl. There's a rim around the bowl, but the water comes up to within 1/8-1/16 of an inch from the top of the rim. If someone were to knock the table where the fountain sits hard enough, I would expect some water to spill out of that bowl. This is true regardless of the pump water-flow setting (I tried all 3).My biggest issue with the fountain is that there is some splash. As shown, the bottom bowl is a big bowl full of water. I've tried various water levels from almost full to not even covering the top of the pump as well as adjusting the water flow setting, but regardless, there is a small amount of splash - with droplets of water appearing on the side of the bottom bowl and some slight specks of water collecting on the table below the fountain. After 10-12 hours of running, there's enough mist/droplets on the table to have to wipe them off. On a glass or well-protected surface, not a problem, but I wouldn't put this on a wood surface. I've also tried tilting the fountain a bit (being careful of the water close to the rim of the 3rd bowl), but I can't figure out how to get rid of the slight splash. If it weren't for the slight splash, I'd easily rate this fountain at 5 stars.",

The only problem I have had was the batteries dying within a day and they were lithium batteries. However because it had a plug in adapter it could still run. I still love it just wish I knew why the batteries kept dying so quickly.Updated Review. I really really loved this fountain however 1) it kept eating the batteries when i tried to use it by battery operation. Luckily i bought the one wth the cord adapter. Sadly after using it for a couple of months now the motor sounds like it is about to go out and end up having to turn it off. I still loved it though. ü•∫",

    "reviewText": "I bought this for my little greenhouse cabinet. It‚Äôs good for the price but certainly constructed cheaply (obviously). When I first pulled it out of the box and filled it with water, it was spurting water out of the bottom and not the top. So I took it apart, gently pulling the tower from the base and unscrewing the top cover. It was broken in one corner and the pump wasn‚Äôt connected to the tube leading up the tower. I snapped those together and found whatever the little light was attached to was snapped off broken as well. So, while all the parts and pieces work, it didn‚Äôt arrive ready to go and required some tinkering. If you buy this and it doesn‚Äôt work correctly, try taking it apart and checking the pump connection. I‚Äôm happy with this purchase overall. I‚Äôm including a photo of the type of pump used in this fountain. Once I connected everything and got it assembled, it worked great. Use distilled water in this only to avoid the mineralization.",

    "reviewText": "This fountain looks great, but I had to do so much just to get it to a place I was happy with. Obviously the pump has to be completely submerged in water to avoid the loud humming, which I did. Despite the water level, it was still extremely noisy, and I couldn't figure out why...After disassembling it completely and just having the pump plugged in by itself, I discovered that the source of the noise was coming from the pump vibrating against the base of the reservoir. Since there was no possible way to adjust the way the pump was positioned in the water, I had to resort to a very weird solution....I grabbed some pipe cleaners, shaped them into a circular fashion, and stuck them at the bottom of the fountain to make a make-shift bed to rest the pump on while it was submerged in the water, and it surprisingly worked like a charm. No more noise.Also the \"rocks\" that this fount comes with are absolutely pathetic. I happened to have a bag of black stones that I use for another fountain in my house that worked will for this one too.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this fountain for our bedroom in hopes it would drown out my husband's snoring. It has a nice relaxing trickling, sound, but alas, it cannot compete with the bear in the bed! Still, I love it. It's quite beautiful especially with the tea candles lit and the glow from those 3 tiny candles illuminates a room so warmly. My only complaint was buying it from Amazon, no sure if it was a third party issue or what, but the box it was shipped in was partially torn, the box the item comes in was really in poor shape, almost looked like a returned item resold as \"new\". One side of the manufacture's box was completely missing. The Styrofoam packaging within the manufacture's box was cracked and taped together. I was fully prepared to return it because it the box was in such poor condition, however, everything works, nothing was missing, and I really do enjoy this little fountain. No issues with splashing. I am going to place large rocks my husband has collected from Utah and Arizona around the base to make it even more eye appealing. I would recommend this fountain for relaxation, but it won't tackle hushing the loud snorer.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I originally ordered this fountain to create a Zen environment since I work from home. For only $30, I figured why not? When I first unboxed the fountain, I was a little bit underwhelmed since the pieces were plastic. It comes with a small pump where you can adjust the flow of the water, the bowl portion and then the top piece (the fountain). It was very easy to assemble and the directions that were included were very clear. I played with the pump settings and found that it was most enjoyable to listen to it on the quietest setting. I know that a lot of other reviews talked about the noise, and I found a way to reduce the vibrating humming sound that the pump makes. I included a video above where you should be able to hear the flowing water, but not any annoying pump sounds. Originally, I placed the fountain on top of the wood surface and the vibrating/humming noises were pretty unbearable. I really wanted to return it. I then cut out a small piece of spongy foam and rested the fountain on top of it. This made it almost completely silent. It is extremely enjoyable for me now. It really absorbs that annoying noise. Another thing is the wire for the pump gets partially submerged in the water and I‚Äôm not sure if this is a hazard or not. I‚Äôve personally had no issues with this. This also comes with six tea light candles and some Riverstones. I added some fake succulents and a couple of crystals for more aesthetically pleasing look. I never write reviews, but this is honestly my favorite and most relaxing decoration I‚Äôve ever bought. I am hoping that this review can help some of you to make a more informed decision.I bought the 5 fake succulents on SHEIN for about $9. Great deal and it adds beautiful detail. The amount of Riverstones that they give you does not completely cover the base of the fountain, so I would suggest buying more. I found cheap ones on Amazon and at bed, bath and beyond.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Before I purchased this I read all the reviews and I read how people jazzed it up and made it look pretty and how they kept the pump from being loud. I took all that into consideration and created mine. I ordered extra succulents and River rocks. I did put the fountain on top of some pieces of bubble wrap and believe it or not, that's a pizza pan tray that everything is on. There is hardly any motor sound. All you hear is the trickling of the water. And there you see my finished project. Remember moving water creates negative ions, negative ions create positive atmosphere and feelings. That's why everything feels so clean, lifted and happy after a good rain. Or if you're by a river or a stream or a waterfall. So get yourself some moving water. Seriously. This is very beautiful and works perfectly. No complaints at all!",

    "reviewText": "I love soft nature noises. I got a Hatch for Christmas but I wanted to escape from lights and technology for a little while. I found a few fountains that I love, this was the only that arrived unbroken and while I think it‚Äôs not the prettiest in my space the sound is too great to give up! It set up so easily but I have recommendations if you get this and are trouble shooting:Make sure you use filtered water. You can buy it at a store. I had distilled water for my Keurig on hand and highly recommend that if you can get some, otherwise 32oz of filtered bottled water is what they want you to use. Distilled however is less than a dollar for a gallon in my area and the jugs are refillable at certain locations.Next I rinsed out EVERYTHING from the rocks to the base to the fountain itself to make sure dust and packaging debris wouldn‚Äôt clog the filter. Just seemed like a wise idea to me. I don‚Äôt want to return this thing or have it ruined.Next I notice some people have difficulty with the sound of the pump. Make sure you read the short quick instructions, but I also found that adjusting the fountain forward in the base and making sure the cord to the outlet doesn‚Äôt touch anything that could cause it to rattle REALLY helped with the noise, so much that there is no pump sound, unless you get up close and personal with it but sitting 2-3 feet away there is only the sweet sound of the water trickling and it‚Äôs wonderful. I have mine set to medium high and the sound is beautiful.Does not come with many rocks but I think what it does come with is nice and pretty and I don‚Äôt intend on getting more any time soon.Good luck and enjoy! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

I have read some of the bad reviews and for now I have no issues at all. I am hoping this one will last awhile. Overall I think it is beautiful and so relaxing and the price wasn't crazy like some of the others i saw. :)",

    "reviewText": "This fountain is exactly what I was looking for. The size is good for a countertop, where I wanted to put another fountain next to it. The design of the fountain is really cute. The whole fountain is plastic resin, so it is light. I like the water noise that it makes, where the water is falling into the jug - the other small fountains that I was looking at didn't have a water noise. I do use distilled water to fill it, but the water does evaporate. I have to fill it every 2-3 days or so, depending on how dry my place is. When the water gets low, the fountain motor will start making a noise, and that is when I re-fill it.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Not perfect, but easy, quiet, and small.",
    "reviewText": "It's served me well over the months I've had this thing. I keep it right by my bed, on my bedside desk. It's very relaxing to listen to, and fun to run your fingers through, which is the most important bit as we all know.I've read some reviews that said it was loud or made a noise. Never happened to me unless the water got too low. I'm 90% sure most of the reviews that complain about this consist of people who forgot evaporation was a thing that happens.It is understandable though, it's small, so doesn't take a ton of water for it to go from the fill line (which is kinda hard to see/find) to a bit too low and you can start to hear the difference; if you were to keep it going 24/7 I'd imagine you'd need to add water to it every 12-ish hours or so to keep 'er healthy.One complaint I do have about it is the little light that they have shining on the sail: it's a bit too bright for night yet too dim for a lit room. It's also non-negotably a part of it. You can't dim it, or turn it off while the water is going, or change the color, etc. If it's on, it's got that orange light shining at it. If you had planned on having this by your bed like me, you either have to get used to the light and be sure it's pointed away from you, or just not have it on going to sleep at all. I eventually settled on the latter.Also, the cable is a bit too short for me, just 1 or 2 more feet would've been perfect. It seems designed to go on a table or something positioned right in front of/ directly above a outlet, but the place I wanted to put it is about half a desk length away, so the cable currently is pulled all the way taught in order for it to just barely reach. The on/off switch being on the cable itself makes this problem especially cumbersome.TLDR:‚Ä¢ I like it a lot, especially for the price.‚Ä¢ It needs refilling due to evaporation‚Ä¢ Point above likely contributes most to the 'noise' complaints you may read about.‚Ä¢ Light on it is unadjustable in its brightness, color, on/off state, etc. Kinda annoying.‚Ä¢ The cable isn't very long, and the on/off switch is on the cable itself, so it must be close to an outlet with a length of the cable itself exposed and reachable.",

You need to fill the water to a level where it falls directly onto the mesh and you'll have zero splashing issues.10 / 10 would buy again.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Pleasant little fountain, but splashes if not set up right.",
    "reviewText": "As I learned, this little guy likes to splash. If you're getting a splash, consider that you may have broken one or two rules:1. Do not overfill the fountain. The water should be just below the screen mesh. Filling the water above the screen mesh will result in a subtle splash that will puddle over time. The mesh is there to break the fall of the stream, let it do it's job even though having the water up higher looks better.2. Keep the rocks off of the mesh. The fountain is covered in notes warning against this out of the box, but here it is again if you missed it.Hope this helps anyone less experienced with fountains like myself.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the look and functionality of this fountain but it‚Äôs too loud for regular bedroom or office. The motor is super quiet unless the later level is too low ( top off water 1x to 2x a day to prevent noise and future damage) It also has slight splashing that add up over time , which may damage future . Iv tried everything to fix the noise and splashing of the water and the only thing thats works it‚Äôs cutting a sponge and placing it on the vertical rocks that stick out. I ordered September of 2023 and it still works great (1 year later). my sponge method works perfectly. { size- small and perfect, value for money- yes , calming- yes but after I added a sponge. 9 out of 10",

So, I moved it to my office and found that the noise is manageable by moving/adding rocks so I'm not off every five minutes to make the bladder gladder (as we used to say). The light is low enough that it adds a bit of ambience without making it look like there's a used car lot in my work space.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this fountain in November and have used it daily. I used only Reverse Osmosis water in it, and cleaned it regularly to remove the sort of ‚Äúslimy‚Äù buildup that occurred in the base. It is now August, 9 months after purchase, and it is splashing so much water out both left and right sides that it has become unusable which is disappointing because I was enjoying it!Pros:* Easy assembly* Nice appearance* Didn‚Äôt require daily refilling (only about every third day)* Pump was quiet* Fairly loud water sounds. You could hear the water sounds in other rooms. This could be a pro or a con depending on what you‚Äôre wanting.Cons:* No adjustment on pump. Maybe my pump arrived broken, but there is no way to adjust the strength of the flow, so it was only high. This meant‚Ä¶* Splashing. No matter how I tried positioning rocks, or removing them altogether, this fountain left splashes around it, particularly on the left side. **This got significantly worse over time.*** Loud water sounds. I wanted more of a ‚Äútrickling‚Äù sound for relaxation purposes, and this was definitely stronger than that, again because the pump lacked any way to adjust the flow strength. This didn‚Äôt stop me from enjoying the fountain while it was functioning properly, it just wasn‚Äôt my preference.If this fountain hadn‚Äôt become so splash-y, I would have rated it higher. As it is, though, only giving 9 months of use, I don‚Äôt believe it gave good value for the money I spent.",

    "reviewText": "This looks great, is nice and compact, and relatively quiet. However, the way the fountain is designed leaves almost no margin for error. It worked great for maybe a week until the pump became slightly weaker, and because the water does not quite make it to the meshed section it just splashes all over the bottom surface and all over the counter. Essentially useless. I mitigated this by putting a little ramp so the water does not splash when it hits, but I absolutely do not believe the pump is high quality at all. I mean, what do you expect for $40, but still...disappointing. Hopefully you'll just get one where the pump works properly for a long time, instead of failing almost immediately, relatively speaking.",

This isn't necessarily a bad thing; both look good, and the bowl is nice and large, and it holds plenty of water to not drop much in level in 24 hours in my dry climate. The way the blueish lights dance off the water is pleasant and makes the fountain into a nightlight. The pump suction-cups to the bottom of the bowl and is much quieter than the water - it makes a low-pitched hum, which is easy to hear when the fountain is on the counter or the room is dead silent. You can feel the bowl vibrating slightly. I'm not getting tired of the water sound after using it constantly for several weeks, though I do have it plugged in to an Alexa plug do I can turn it off with my voice while watching a movie. The power connections to the light cords inside are totally secure and waterproof. I haven't measured the change in humidity, but I can feel a significant improvement in the humidity levels in my apartment - I've even gotten used to leaving the bedroom door open at night and sleeping to the sound of it. Topping it off with filtered water in the morning is easy to do. Recommended!",

Best of all, you cannot hear the pump running and hear nothing more but the gentle trickling of water (see video). I found that it splashed a bit onto my table on the medium setting so I turned it down to low and not one drop splashes out. I had an issue with two of my lights and contacted seller. The customer service was great and they sent me out a new pump/light component and I received it a couple days later.",

    "reviewText": "I have another Amazon water fountain (Copper Water Lily). After 4 years it is still working perfectly but I wanted a larger table fountain. This fountain surpassed my expectations! It‚Äôs the perfect size (not too large) but makes a bold statement. The lighting is an extra bonus. I love the water sound, I have it on 1 notch above slow. The higher settings ran too fast for me. Another Amazon customer stated he uses an Alexa plug to turn it on and off because it doesn‚Äôt have an on and off switch. It‚Äôs a great idea omitting the need to plug it in and pulling it out. I have received so many compliments. Most people say it is ‚Äúbeautiful and a piece of art!",

He mailed me a broken water pump, I informed him it was broken only to receive another water pump from the seller that was also broken. Both times the water pump was not packaged correctly and arrived broken. This is so very unacceptable. I am extremely disappointed with this product and the seller for not ensuring the water pump was packaged correctly. I will never order from this seller again.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Wonderful. Good trickling rivulet sound. We took a few sprigs from the artificial Bonsai trees to add a few \"bushes\" and have played around adding various rough crystals. No splashing as is, but if you add stuff it depends where you place it. Lots of room to sort of design and create your own Zen waterfall üßé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòå Fun!The pump is very quiet, but a vibration was created with the supporting table. A folded towel underneath quieted the buzzing some but not completely, but by adding three small prism stones directly underneath the bowl to create a tiny tripod of sorts the buzzing vibration was eliminated completely, so now there's just the sound of the water, which can be slightly varied by stone placements. This table is on wheels, a more solid table might not have this sound vibration issue.One serious drawback in design is that, although having a water flow adjustment is a nice optional control; it is located directly on the pump. So if you want to change the speed of the water flowing, you have to completely remove the top cascading rock design off the bowl to adjust the slider on the pump, which is very awkward.Not being able to turn the lights off is another drawback, but we just put stones over them to cover and block or soften the light intensity. Also depending on the transparency of the crystal you can modify the color shade of the light.The material looks like real rock.Very happy and satisfied with this.",

Not loud at all but perfect when it is quiet and you need the sound of water trickling down a face of ledge rocks. I replaced the stones it came with, with polished stones from a National Geographic set. Just be careful to keep the water level at full so as not to burn out the pump. I have to add water at least every other day because my home has forced air heating and it is very dry during the winter. All in all I am very happy with this purchase so far. It's been about a month since I've been using it.",

    "reviewText": "The fountain looks beautiful especially during the night where you can see the spinning ball with different colors. The major detraction is their warranty. It isn't stated on this product page, but when you contact the seller, they will let you know it's 3 months. Product is subpar because my pump only lasts a little over 6 months. I'm giving it 4 stars since seller was willing to find a solution for me to replace my pump. I wish the warranty was longer like most products (usually 1 year).",

What I like about it is that it‚Äôs quiet, easy to assemble (there are only 3 pieces I think), easy to maintain and with it‚Äôs simple lines, aesthetically pleasing.I have tried other table top fountains and after a while, the engine starts breaking down. The rocks and other decorations also get in the way of the water flow.This model had one other decoration, a plastic tree which I ended up removing. I like that the water flow is unobstructed.Note that it‚Äôs best to use distilled water and I add vinegar (about 1 cup to a gallon of water). The water condenses so it‚Äôs best to add water daily. When you forgot to add water, the product gives a strange noise.Good buy!",

    "reviewText": "My tabletop fountain arrived a few days ago on time and in perfect condition. It looks exactly like the picture and is quite lovely and serene. It is very quiet unlike some where all you can hear is the pump. When Im still and quiet I can hear the water softly flowing. I have not been able to get the pump to stick to the bottom. Hard to explain, but you have to tip the top part with the buddha on it forward if you want to stick the pump to the bottom, but when you do that it doesn't reach. If you do not put it all the way forward you cannot get your fingers in enough to push the pump to the bottom. I think there needs to be an opening on the top part behind the buddah where you can get a finger or two in to push the pump to the bottom. To much work for me, I just let it float as is and it works fine. Also, you may want to fill it with water and adjust the pump before you put the top part on. I filled mine with water put the top on and filled it with some small pebbles I had. When I turned it on the water splashed onto the tabletop. Not really a big deal because its glass but if it was wood or anything else it could get damaged. So I turned it off, took out the pebbles and the top with the buddha and adjusted the speed on the pump. It works great now. I have put it on every night for the last week and I enjoy it very much.",

    "reviewText": "OK -Then. I just layed electrical wires under water and I'm not shocked. Nice! Sure hope the wire coating lasts a while or it's lights out.-Alright, now, the good and bad. It does look good and it works just fine. The bad is that their are no real step by step instruction with this. Their needed and I'll tell you why. The pump has a slide controller on it to regulate the flow of water. Did you even know that? If you look on the side of the pump, it's the little lever there. But, this is not explained anywhere. Also, the tube that puls into the bottom of the buddah, is too short and I could not secure the pump with the suction cups because it won't reach the bottom, so it just floats. But, this too is not explained. There are not many parts to this but a video or some written instructions are needed. If anyone has a problem, let me know. I'll help you put it together. The light bulb needs to be plugged in real good or it will fall out, and their hard to find. Because there is no on/off switch on this, (there should be), I ran a extension cord to a switched outlet. Now, when I shut off the main lights, this turns off too. So, good fountain for the money but the makers need to add:1. step by step instructions or post a video2.make the intake tibe longer3. supply extra bulb",

Keep in mind that there is a lever on the pump to adjust the water flow. I had it on the lowest setting at first (thinking it looked like that was the highest) and I couldn‚Äôt hear the water like that. It‚Äôs a perfect flow on the highest setting with the switch turned all the way up and no splash off the sides as long as you have the rocks positioned right. I love this fountain!",

It has just the right amount of trickle sound from the water (if you have the pump adjusted correctly).

    "reviewText": "The first time I got this for myself it was so easy to assemble, came with all the pieces, looked great once done.Recently my mom got diagnosed with cancer, so I ordered it to bring it back to her in Canada. Once we got to Canada and i started assembling it, I realized the main connector piece that connects the light bulb to the body of the plug was missing. What results is that the water will still flow, but we can never tell when the thing is plugged in because the light isn't connected! So basically it is usable but not really.This is extremely disheartening especially since we don't live in Canada and fixing such a SMALL problem will take a VERY LONG TIME. It's so frustrating too because this was meant to be a gift for a cancer patient who actually takes the whole buddha idea very seriously, especially since now she has so little certainty in life and so much to be afraid of.Needless to say I'm EXTREMELY ANGRY with this company for missing that tiny little piece. If something can be done to fix my situation I'd be extremely grateful.",

    "reviewText": "This water fountain is a fantastic addition to any office or living space to provide quaint background noise and aesthetic pleasing!The build quality is great! I ran the pump continuous for 24 hours to make sure the pump ran great with no issues. From there, I let it continually run the majority of the day. The lights are bright enough in the dark to notice them, but not overbearing. Additionally, the power cord is a USB connection with a USB wall plug, so that provides some flexibility in terms of plugging in the unit.I opted to provide additional rocks to the unit to mitigate splashing. The addition of rocks allowed the water to roll off of the flower pods right onto the rocks and worked great. Make sure to read the instructions to fully understand the operation of the fountain.Finally, I want to commend the seller on the packaging of the unit. The packaging was very thought out and provided security to the unit during shipping.All in all, a very quality product to increase overall comfort and peacefulness within a space.",

I like the effect of the lights. You can choose the remote button to choose the mode water , water with lights. Or lights only. You can adjust the water flow volume/speed of flow. The faster the more bell sounds. Without the bell and stone abd the water flow it wont move. So i have to find the bakance where how many stine to put and how close the bell hangs at yhe back.",

However, the emptying leaf only works when fountain is on a high setting and thus, water splashes everywhere. As a matter of fact, no matter what setting it's on, water is splashing everywhere. It's very messy. I do love that it is easy to clean. The lights aren't bright enough to use as any type of true light- gentle lighting as part of the ambiance. Think christmas lights.",

But now after once again cleaning, using vinegar, etc. Tried taking it apart, but it doesn't really come apart other than at top cup which is where I would use a small brush. But, alas, It no longer works. Off to the trash.My cats love drinking from a fountain and when old one died after several years, had to replace. This one is perfect size. It has pleasant sound, tho I removed the bell. Can adjust flow and lights to your preference. Good value.",

Nigel was the same color as the light Buddha is holding so in my heart I feel that he is still with me all the time and guided this purchase.

Also, there is no on-off switch. You just plug it and inplug it to turn it on and off. Considering it's electricity and water, I don't really like that. I plugged it in a power bar. It also makes the cable almost impossible to hide since you need to always be able to access it to turn it on and off. Besides that it's cute and very quiet.",

I didn't get my big, fancy waterfall, but I wasn't going to let that stop me from adding a little zen to my space.I searched for a while to find something that would work well in my commercial space, and I think I found it in this little cutie. I especially like that the top looks like Grogu's pod,and may have to figure out a way to incorporate him in there...This fountain is quiet and the trickle is nice. The orb does rattle a little bit, but not enough to bother me. It's just the right height for my space, and fits in well. I did add some glass pebbles from the Dollar Tree, to cover the base, as this style doesn't include them. Happy with this purchase,and hope it lasts a long time!",

    "reviewTitle": "Nice Looking - Can be Loud",
    "reviewText": "Liked the look of this desktop fountain and it runs well. However not currently able to use it as it is too loud for my studio space due to the design and water drop back into the pool. I'm in a 12 x 12 room, albeit with a lot of hard surfaces (floors, walls, desks) so the water sound quickly moves from soothing trickle noises to reverberating distraction. To spin the ball the pump has to be on the second highest setting only. Anything less and the ball stalls or only vibrates, high speed, the water shoots off the back of the ball and on to desk and floor. It looks nice in our decor, so I kept it and have the LEDs lighting the ball without the pump and may rig it in the future as an atomizer to create a fog illusion in the centre design. It just doesn't work as intended in my office space - may be great in a different setup and if the limitations of my environment are removed, it's worth the 4-stars. Disappointed I can't use it in my space and so not advised for a smaller quiet office area or where lots of impromptu Zoom or Teams meetings are frequent unless you can unplug it easily / quickly. Sounds to remote users like you're in the bathroom, LOL!",

The splashing from the water left a real sticky residue around the unit so I constantly had to clean it, and the ball would constantly need to get polished up due to hard water. Otherwise it just kinda stops spinning and sits there hahaha. Eventually I took it down and stored it for a few months till I found a new spot for it. When I wired it back up and started filling it, the thing started leaking hard out the bottom. So yeah it was pretty cool for a bit but I don't think I'm ever buying anything like this again hahaha.2/10",

    "reviewText": "I purchased these as it hit my two main criteria for work office decor, it was cheap and not terribly tacky.I wanted a quiet sound of running water in my office, the noise helps me focus. I was disheartened initially as it was nearly silent, and by nearly I mean it didn't even so much as produce sound other than the hum of the pump. I noticed upon assembly that it hard some sort of black plastic restrictor inside the hose that runs from the pump to the top bowl. I used a tool to remove this restrictor and that massively improved the flow. It now generates a delightful trickle!Not featured in the listing are the included small pebbles and glass marble ball thing. The instructions make no mention of placement for the marble in the feature, it only fits in the top ball. I assume it is to create the effect of the ball spinning or bobbing. However, it is far too heavy an merely acts as yet another restriction for flow. This is OK as with the pump turned to full with the restrictor removed it is a little aggressive, but slower speeds lead the pump to more hum.All in all, it balances itself out nicely. It produces the sound I was looking for and the design isn't terribly obtrusive.",

I‚Äôm glad I did as there were some plastic shreds. The pump has four settings. It seemed to have some noise as the slowest setting, but I‚Äôm using the highest. It‚Äôs very quiet overall. If it started to make some some vibrations, I‚Äôd wiggle the cord to adjust the location of the pump and it would be fine. Not having enough water would cause noise too.Is far as a trickling sound, I never seemed to get one. I tried the different pump speeds with and without the rocks. Probably just because it is small, but otherwise, it‚Äôs a cute little thing.",

    "reviewText": "Such a cute little water feature for the price but you can hear the water trickle (which is kind of the point). Luckily you can't hear the motor either. The glass ball that came with won't roll. It's too heavy. It was the biggest pain to put together we had to cut a piece of the tubing to fit. The rocks are cute. If you think the little water holders are wood covered. Nope. They are just plastic made to look like wood. It's not horrible, but I wouldn't gift it to anyone unless you warn them it's not high quality.",

I wanted something pretty to look at, but I find the sound of running water too distracting. This fountain is perfect for me- I only hear it when the water level in the bottom gets too low. The pump is practically silent- I can only hear it buzzing if I put my ear next to it. The rocks and light in the bottom cup are cute, too. This is exactly what I was looking for.",

I would have liked it to have a water trickling/flowing noise, but it does not. If you remove the floating ball, you can hear the water sound, although it may splash water without it. I also would have liked the base to have a notch for the cord as the top doesn't sit quite flush with the base because of the cord. Overall, very nice fountain. Adding additional rocks (purchased separately) adds to the appeal.",

    "reviewText": "The fountain is exactly what I wanted for my home office. It‚Äôs fairly sturdy and eye-pleasing for the price-point. The set up was easy and the LED light gives it a nice glow. I agree with other posts that it doesn‚Äôt make much sound, but I fixed that issue by placing a few small stones on each leaf at the spout. Theadditional stones created a little more water pooling on each leaf, creating that classic trickling water sound.",

    "reviewText": "Take the LED light piece and slide it through the pipe, then connect the water pump to the end of the pipe. Only the water pump should be touching the water. Make sure to fill the container ALL the way to the very top but before doing so, apply the rocks to your liking so that it wont add weight to the water flow. Give the fountain a second to push the water through and IF you do not fill the fountain all the way to the very top, the ball wont spin and the water wont flow and it will also cause it to make a very loud weird noise. Hope this helps!!",

If you add too little you can hear the motor trying to suck up the water. If you add even a little too much the water shoots past the peddle and will land on the surface you‚Äôve placed the fountain on. I‚Äôm disappointed with this purchase. Instead of it being peaceful, it‚Äôs requires maintenance every single day.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my circa 1998 concrete 3-tier table fountain, which I was using to put a little moisture in the air in the kitchen, where my houseplants are growing. I stumbled upon this fountain, and chose it because it looks both gorgeous and as if it would take up even less room than my old table sized fountain.Got it, unpacked it, it was a breeze to put together. It has an on/off switch on the cord, which is so much better than having to unplug the unit entirely. It gave off a lot of mist , the colors are a beautiful, rich shade of green-aqua-blue....And unfortunately, there should have been a red color as well . A few of the tiny bulbs were out.The item was otherwise working so well that I really considered just keeping it, but I ultimately decided to return the defective model and replace it with the same product. But then I discovered that Canary has, for the same price as this unit, an otherwise identical model with a remote control! So I bought that one, which arrived today.The new unit was up and running in about 2-3 minutes flat, all the colors are working great, as is the remote, there's 16 different color features for blending colors, having only one stationary color ,having no color, 9 different mist settings....Unfortunately, there is no green color. This one is blue-red-yellow, not blue-red-green....And the green on the other unit really was a gorgeous shade of deep emerald, especially when it was running in an otherwise darkened room.Sigh....I have tried to give the cons (no remote, no green) and the pros (everything else!) about both units. A remote is great, but an on/off switch on the cord is still pretty darn convenient. Both are quiet, colorful, and give off a lot of mist. According to my pocket humidity tester, these units raise the moisture in the air percentage in their proximity from 39-40% to 44-45%. No idea of exact range, but I have placed my unit in the middle of a large credenza, on which I have 10 herbs in pots growing. I believe it has enough range to cover that space, and the tester seems to confirm this. Hopefully that'll be enough to keep my poor plants happy until they can go outside again.I highly recommend either model, and I will probably wind up buying that floor stand model for the living room. The plants in there deserve a little more moisture too. :-)",

I had direct Number to one of the menager and was able to get in touch with John who actually was kind and nice and explained me problem with water chemistry ! I add some shells to tap water to help the water get some more minerals and leave the fogger over night and day . Evening I put on and works perfectly thanx again !!!!",

BUT the next time I filled it, it began to leak. It leaked all over the wood floor, and ruined the parquet. :( The plug will NOT stay secure in the hole...it pops right out, and if it's in tight, it drips anyway. Maybe a cork would have worked better. TOTAL WASTE OF $!! ...unfortunately, it's unusable... But it was very cool and pretty at first. I never write reviews, but in this circumstance, I wanted to warn other people about this issue. Terrible design, poor quality...Seriously, they've got to know this doesn't work, so why don't they fix the problem?",

    "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for a family member who is a therapist. We put it in her office and it works beautifully (I use the office on occasion for consulting). The item is very sturdy and is much more attractive than the photograph on Amazon. The mist is very soothing and relaxing aesthetically. The diffuser works well with all varieties of essential oils and has a very calming effect. The red, green, or blue lights on the diffuser give off just enough subtle light without looking cheap or gaudy.We've had this running, almost on a daily basis, for over 8 months and it is still the perfect touch for the professional, calming ambience that we needed for the office. I'm considering purchasing one for my home office.",

It may take a couple of tries to make the pump stick to the bottom and get some good water flow going but when it does the result is mesmerizing. It‚Äôs whisper quiet and the ball spins freely.The water needs replacement once a week as it tends to get murky. You know it‚Äôs time for a change when it‚Äôs stops being quiet and you hear a soft grinding sound.My suggestion, instead of taking it apart to replace the water, is to unplug it, put the ball aside, and take the whole unit to the sink, and replace the water. This way you don‚Äôt have to re-assemble it every time. Just make sure you remember to replace the ball before you turn it on.",

    "reviewText": "Received and set up was easy. Worked right off and has a pleasant sound. Lights are bright and at night create an interesting light pattern. After running for two days, had some issues. Lights were dim and pump barely moved water. If I disconnected the lights the motor ran fine. Reconnecting the lights, had bright lights that dimmed and motor loss power. Instead of trying to box item up and return it to Amazon, I went on Alpines Corporation web sight, and made a warranty claim. I filled in the claim form and sent it electronically. In my email I restated what had happened. Within two days (on a Saturday) I received a response from a customer service representative. She, right off, processed my claim and offered to replace the lights and pump. Within five days of my initial inquiry the parts were shipped. Through UPS. I received them fairly quickly, UPS had a delay. Everything works well and I am happy with the product and Alpine Corporation. They stood behind the product and sent me the necessary parts to have it working again. I highly recommend the product and the company. The representative was very polite and attentive to my issues and quickly resolved the matter.Again, this is a nice table top fountain. It is pleasant to watch and creates a relaxing atmosphere. I am going to use it in a vivarium. It is made of good quality. There were some pieces that rattle in side, left over from manufacturing, but were easily removed.I highly recommend the product and the Alpine Corporation.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the way it looks. I like the water sound. The only problem is that the sound of the pump motor is just as loud as the water trickling. It's rather annoying. Is this what others are calling 'a quiet motor'? If I have a bad motor, it would be nice to know. I like the fountain enough that I'm tempted to just buy another motor, but the thought of taking it apart and trying to install a new one makes me cringe.11/5/22 Update. I've had this in my office since the purchase for no other reason that I've not had the desire to bother with another motor. I have used it on and off since then. I've had to knock this down to a single star, though. The main reason is leaking. It's leaked a few times now. The leak split my $50 wood tray that I bought for the fountain. I can glue that, so it's not that big of a deal, but it's frustrating. See attached photo. You need a flashlight to look into the reservoir to be able to see at what level the water is at. There is no marker so you really don't know if you're at the right level or over the level. This just isn't worth the hassle. It looks great, but the functionality is subpar at best. I've decided to try a fountain that has a separate reservoir where I can simply lift the fountain off of the bowl when needed and can easily see the water level. This fountain is a single moulded piece with a tiny sliding door in the back that you can't even fit your entire hand into to reach the motor. I do not recommend this product, unfortunately.",

Because of the discrepancy, I did not give 5 stars.I like the amount of water regardless of not being able to adjust the flow, and it produces a nice sound for a 12X15 room. The rim is damp in the bottom/main basin, but after 8 hours of running, there was no over splash. On the shelf or the floor.The material is fairly heavy and it seems to be a nice color/quality. It fits in with the room colors and plants at my desk.It was mostly assembled. All I had to do was un pack, connect light connector, fill with water and plug it in.Very minimal. It is a tight squeeze getting the pump in and out with your hand and I had to use a pen to get the pump placed and pull the pump out by the cord. My hand would not fit in side. I can't reach an octave on a piano, but my hand muscles are fairly developed.The lights are better in pictures, but it is really nice.",

    "reviewText": "Some have said it looks cheap, but I disagree. It is resin and the one I got was perfectly finished and it looks even better than the photos. The coloring on the Elephants is perfect. The detail is very good and there is no visible seams. As long as you have good dexterity, it is easy to assemble. Mostly just pushing the clear vinyl hoses all the way onto the pump and getting the pump inside with it in the correct position. At first, it was placed on a bookcase that was tilted slightly. It caused it to seem like there was a leak, but with the tilt, the water was dribbling down the back and we didn't notice it until the next day. We moved it to a level table and it has not leaked since. It has been running 24/7 for at least a week with no issues. The pump is silent. I can barely hear the fast rolling ball, and the water trickle is very faint. My biggest concern was the pump noise, but again, it is completely silent. I just wish they made one about six feet tall to put in my Florida room. The ball would be as big as a soccer ball...LOL.",

It arrived in perfect condition and set up for him was not hard at all! He loves it! The colors are beautiful and it was a perfect addition to his elephant collection. It sits on his nightstand.

If you let the water get too low the ball will stop spinning and it could burn up the motor.",

I do have to take the whole fountain out if the terrarium periodically and clean it, including the little sponge filter inside the pump itself, which opens and cleans very easily. I was happy with how enclosed the fountain is, I didn't have to worry about plugging up any holes to keep critters out of the inner workings. The pump is silent but the water makes a faint 'trickle' sound that gets a little louder when the water needs refilling. I love this product so much I bought two of them.",

    "reviewText": "I love this fountain - the look of it is attractive and gives a peaceful feeling. It provides just the right amount of water sound - not too much or too little, with NO splashing! The pump is extremely quiet, at least most of the time - it occasionally makes a little bit of noise for a while, I'm kind of assuming it may suck up some bit of debris on those occasions, because it's so quiet the rest of the time - virtually can't even tell it's running. As mentioned in other reviews the LED lights are bright, but that is easily remedied by a few well-placed rocks (a previous separate purchase), to cover or divert the light. I do like the light once the rocks toned it down, it definitely adds to the fountain. The only 'negative' I can post is that it's a little awkward getting to the pump, etc., since it's all self-contained within the fountain, but it's doable and I don't know how else it could be handled other than if the fountain had a bowl under it that the pump rested in, but of course that would give it a bigger footprint and it's a nice compact size as is - not too small, not too big. No complaints, very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to others!",

I had to experiment with the water level to see which one would reduce the pump sound and increase the water flow even more. The led lights make it look more beautiful especially when to turn off the lights.Overall definitely recommend!Updated July 28th 2024: The sound of the pump is still very quiet but the water sounds very relaxing.

    "reviewText": "If you are intending to get this fountain to create the sound of moving water, you will need it within 5 feet of your head to hear it. I hoped with this many stages of falling water, it would be loud enough to put it in my office or bedroom, to drown out some ambient noises. However, it's more of a decorative piece than an ambient sound machine.It definitely looks cool, but I was hoping it would create a lot more sound. In the description it does say \"quiet\" water sound, so I can't complain too much. Overall, it's a good fountain, easy to assemble and use. Just fill the bottom of the unit up until it's 60-75% full (in the outer, bottom bowl). I'll probably end up returning it myself, just because I don't care how it looks. I wanted a louder fountain, I suppose I could mod this one to make it louder.",

No big debris can get in unless it goes into the hole the water flows through at the bottom pond.As long as you keep that sponge clean it works amazing.

The 3 top cascades of water began to run down the walls of the bowls instead of falling into the little pools. End of cascading water. And since paint the has washed off, the overall appearance of the fountain is diminished. And no more pretty tiers of cascading water. Now I'm waiting for the dissolved paint particles to plug the pump, ending everything. I'm now past the return period, so I GUESS I'M STUCK WITH THIS PIECE OF EXPENSIVE JUNK.",

Not enough of an issue though to warrant not getting it (to be expected with a water fountain).",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Fountain. Instructions need work. See below if you have difficulty during setup.",
    "reviewText": "As I find happening more and more these days, products that arrive work exactly how they should but due to instructions that lack proper detail the setup is often frustrating and may even dishearten you enough to return it. The customer can even find themselves thinking they have a faulty product when in reality the instructions skipped over something that could solve the problem. Some times you may feel a little \"stupid\" when you realize where you messed up but let's just assume that you have no idea how ANYTHING works. So here are the few things that, if you have never owned a fountain before and have precisely no idea what to expect (which is what instruction manual writers should always be assuming when considering wording, what explanations should be included, and visual aid. Think of that instructions giving exercise you might have done in school during which you give step by step DETAILED instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.), this is what you need to know.First. Have several towels ready. Put one down, put the fountain on top of it and be prepared to switch them out. Put a bowl of water under the table you have the fountain it on if you have to. After I write this I will be blow drying the carpet.In regards to the following steps.3. Check that the pump is firmly connected to the water tubing that is built into the fountain and the pump is sitting flat on the bottom of the reservoir.A bit of clarification: The pump and the water tubing are not actually connected already. However, because everything is packed in so tightly it gives the illusion that it may in fact be quite secure. There are warnings all over the place that if you damage the tubing your warranty is voided which gives the customer a sense of uncertainty about handling the pump at all. And of course you can't actually see anything in the reservoir so that isn't helpful. Also getting the pump to stay flat while the reservoir is dry is more trouble than it's worth so keep reading.Side note: There is a small grey slider on the pump that determines the strength of the flow. Make sure that is all the way on. Because it didn't seem to mark which way to slide it (there is a good possibility it is in fact marked however when I figured this part out the pump was inside the fountain already), keep this in mind for the bit of troubleshooting clarification at the end of this review.5. Fill the fountain with enough water to keep the pump fully submerged during operation, approximately 6 cups.Note: The image above the worded instructions shows the water being dumped into the bottom pool where the light is located. Don't do that. There is no way to truly feel or see if the pump is actually submerged. Get a funnel, make sure you have a good light source angled towards the back of the fountain (where the access panel door is meant to go once setup is complete. The panel should not yet be in place.) With the pump pushed in as far as possible but NOT holding it down, fill the reservoir, slowly, by pouring the water into the funnel first. Once the pump is submerged as much as it can be , remove the funnel, reach in and push it down gently, ensuring that the suction cups on the pump are properly secured. If the pump is now sticking out of the water, reinsert the funnel and add more water until the pump is submerged.Note on the note: At the bottom it states \"Note: When first plugged in, there may be air in the pump. It may take several moments for trapped air to escape, allowing water to flow.\"When it says several moments, it means it. I'm not saying two or three seconds I'm saying give it a good thirty before deciding that the flow may not be strong enough.And on that note on the note, the troubleshooting I mentioned. If it seems that the water flow is terribly weak but it's clear that the water is not being backed up (the pool at the bottom isn't overflowing therefore proving that the problem is most likely not kinking or a break in the tube) reach back in and feel for the pump. Feel for that grey slider and push it in the opposite direction. The flow should immediately increase. This just means when you slid it over the first time you slid it in the wrong direction. If the flow DOES NOT increase, check again that the tubing is secured to the pump properly. Though I found once it was, it didn't slide off easily.About the visual aid.I can't even fully explain what is depicted in the little bubble next to the image of the fountain. There is a square pointing towards a line that has another square protruding from it and what looks like a chord dangling out of it? I couldn't tell you what that was supposed to signify other than don't have this thing plugged in when dealing with water. But it could also be referring to the light splitter which is used to, as I'm sure you've guessed, split the power so the pump gets the proper voltage and the light gets the proper voltage without needing two separate AD wall adapters. But because it isn't clear, that can put some doubt in your mind as to whether or not you're missing something.Concerning Troubleshooting SectionThere are an abundance of troubleshooting steps listed with this product. They are basically just for if the pump doesn't work at all. I mean it doesn't even turn on. There was almost nothing about if the product functions but not as expected. That is why I was fumbling around so much and figured out the little tip about the slider on the pump. A troubleshooting guide should essentially be worded like \"If this is happening make sure that this is secured/plugged in/properly positioned etc. Not the case here.In conclusion: The fountain is wonderful. It does exactly what is shown in the video in the description. It sounds great, looks great, and is extremely soothing. I would love to fill my house with these or even get a floor standing one just to have more of that atmosphere in every room, but alas I live in an apartment (with a landlord who, let's just say, deserves his own written review. I'll do that in the proper venue once I've moved out.) But the instructions are poorly written. As I said. All manuals should be done assuming the customer knows nothing. This may seem like a useless review to someone who had prior knowledge, but to those of us that literally have no idea, it will help you.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I Love This Fountain!",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This fountain has a beautiful and natural-looking design and a quiet but strong pump. I have the pump set at roughly the middle speed and it is perfect for me. The water noise is super relaxing, but loud enough to be prominent in my bedroom. I sleep about 9 feet away and cannot hear the pump from that distance (I can barely hear it even 3 feet away if I listen closely for it). I have trouble getting to sleep, but this has helped a lot. I now look forward to turning on my fountain and relaxing when I come home from work. This is one of those items that I wish I bought years ago. It is expensive, but well worth the money. I have only two minor complaints besides the price (which, to be fair, seems in line with comparable fountains): the lack of an on/off switch and the fact that there is only a light on one of the levels. But those issues hardly detract from how much I like this fountain. I only had it for two days, so I can't speak to longevity, but it has made quite the positive impression and I feel confident it will last long. I will try to remember to update the review in a few months.I attached two pictures and one video. While all of them show the fountain with the light on in a dark room, one video and one photo were taken with the flash on so that you can see the whole fountain (the vertical video is deliberate because of the shape of the fountain, but I am typically against vertical video). The other photo was taken without the flash and shows what you would actually see in a dark room. Amazon does not allow us to upload two videos or I would have also uploaded the video taken without the flash.",

    "reviewText": "This is my 2nd Sunnydaze fountain. The first works great and doesn‚Äôt splash or dump water out. This particular fountain has a fatal design flaw - when the water level gets low through evaporation, the water cascading to the bottom level bounces back up and out of the fountain. After waking up multiple times to a soaking table and floor, I decided to try various water levels to isolate the problem.My findings - the bottom level where the LED‚Äôs are is concave in shape. When the water level is shallow enough to allow the water to pour onto the concave surface, it bounces upwards and out of the left side of the fountain. I placed a small rock in the bottom atop the LED‚Äôs to break up the water flow which did work for the low water level condition. Alternatively, when the fountain is full, there is a tremendous amount of splash out which also soaks the surrounding area.These flaws destroyed a piece of wood furniture and also damaged my wood floors.To top it off, the seller doesn‚Äôt accept returns.It‚Äôs a beautiful fountain but should only be used outdoors where water won‚Äôt cause damage.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. turned out to be a major disappointment. It has design flaws, The biggest issue is the splashing‚Äîwater ends up everywhere, making a mess around the fountain. It's not only annoying but also a hassle to clean up constantly.I wouldn't recommend this product. There are better options out there that don't create such a mess. I had to turn mine off because the noise was overwhelming too - Im sitting in the living room and it sounds like someone is pissing in a toilet. LOL -wouldn't recommend for indoor use unless you can make some modifications to reduce splashing and noiseMaybe outside porch would work better!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars So glad I bought this tabletop waterfall",
    "reviewText": "Despite the mixed reviews on this product, I ordered it and am so glad I did. It arrived with a gash in the box, but the item itself was well insulated and didn't have any damage. The water flows beautifully - the lights are delightful - and the pump is quieter than expected - you can definately hear the bubbling waterfall over the pump hum. The pump did seem a little louder for the first 24 hours, but it seemed to quiet down a bit after that (or I just got used to it and am now able to focus on the sound of the water flowing over it)! Becareful not to overfill it though. I filled it to the max line when I first got it and it ran beautifully for a week - no spills, no splashes. However, the water did appear a little low so I added water to it, but apparently I added too much and for the next 2 days it splashed and leaked a little, but once the water level went back to \"normal\" it's been fine since. I am usuing it in a busy grooming salon to help occupy the focus of some nervous clients that sit and wait for their pet to be groomed. It is very calming and helps add a sense of tranquility to the shop. Kids find it pleasing to look at too! I even added a few drops of aromatherapy to the water to add another layer of relaxation through scent to aide our most anxious (human) clients! I would HIGHLY recommend this tabletop waterfall.",

    "reviewText": "I read the reviews and had high hopes for this fountain, but it fell way short of my expectations and I am returning it.At first, it was a bit loud, but I made sure to add water so that it covered the pump and it could still be heard over the running water, but was not as loud as it first was. Still, it's not something I would want running in my room at night because it was not whisper-quiet as the drinking fountain my cats have. I know that it is POSSIBLE to make an economical pump that isn't loud. The makers of this fountain might want to check in to that.I could deal with the loudness by placing it in the dining room or living room, but the final straw was that it LEAKED. The leak was somewhere in the base, because that's where the water was pooled. The sides were dry, so it wasn't leaking from the sides, but the bottom was soaked. There were no visible marks that it was leaking from, but after unplugging it and picking it up, water just seemed to seep out of some unseen source and drip from the bottom.I didn't expect too much from a 55 dollar fountain, but I wanted one that didn't leak and had a pump that was somewhat quiet. This did not live up to my expectations and is being returned.",

    "reviewText": "So the product was great until it wasn't.. After a few months the pump had stopped to a trickle.. Before tossing the pump and ordering a new one, I gave it one last clean.. While doing that, I found, shoved up in the hose line, was a cut piece of it, to restrict flow (see pic).. My guess is after a year or so you figure the pump gave out and it's time to buy a new one.. Well it's not, I shoved a screw driver up there and got it out.. My fountain works like brand new again and I have a feeling itll stay working like new üôÉ.. Im not gonna say, when it was new, MAYBE it needed the cut piece of tube to restrict the flow, so it wasn't to much, BUT it ended up ruining it almost.. Were gonna say it was a mistake hopefully, bc other then this issue, it's been doing what it's supposed to do and been very nice to have.. Thanks!",

    "reviewText": "Really enjoying this pretty fountain. Other reviewers found the pump to be loud, but ours is very quiet. The sound of the water falling is more noticeable than the sound of the pump, which is just a very low level of \"white noise\". We had one issue, but fixed it with some trial and error. The directions say to set the pump at maximum volume, which I did. However over the course of a day the unit leaked out much of its water. Upon close inspection I could see that it was losing water from the bottom pool due to some excess overflow at one low spot in the rim. We thought about building up the rim there, but couldn't think of an aesthetic way to do it. So I pulled the pump and experimented with flow levels. The lower setting was too low, and made the water barely trickle through the pools. But the medium setting was just right, creates a good waterfall but doesn't allow excess water to build up in the bottom pool.Whenever it starts to \"whisper\" a little, indicating low water levels, I just pour a cup or two of water in and it's been working fine.",

To note I had to run the pump at 1/4 setting to keep water from splashing out of the unit. The pump is quiet. The lights are amazing. Three lights illuminate the fountain very well out on our deck at night. I think this fountain will move from the deck in the summer time to inside of our house for the winter. Nice product and well worth the cost.",

    "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Elegant, quiet, ball no spinny",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a very simple, yet elegant looking desk waterfall/fountain. It's also not exactly what I was looking for, before i really knew what i was looking for.It is extremely simple to put together (basin, pump, fountain base, water cups... and the decorative rocks and glass ball).However, when I assembled, filled, and ran it, I found two things that weren't to my liking:1. It was almost silent. I was expecting some amount of flowing water sound as soothing background noise but there was none. I tried removing the glass ball from the top cup to increase flow but everything is too close to the next recepticle to generate any noise. If you want visual aesthetic with no sound, this is your fountain.2. The ball doesn't spin much/at all. Other reviews recommend adding water but that is not a silver bullet. I tried filling it to almost overflowing and draining it to just enough to keep flowing, no spinny.So I tried some configuration changes to try and improve the glass ball visual aesthetic and provide some flowing water ambience. After a little trial and error, I came. up with the following, as shown in the pic and vid:- Remove the bottom (LED holding) cup. This allows the water to drop from the third cup straight into the water basin through the hole where the last cup should be.- Place the LED in the runoff hole of the fountain base in front of where the bottom cup goes.- Place the glass ball on top of the LED to help obscure the space where the last cup should be.- Lay the rocks around the fountain base, using 2-3 to help build up the 'wall' hiding where the water flows into the basin.This will not give you a spinning ball but it will light it up and provide some subtle background trickling water. You're welcome.I don't usually expect to have to hack something to suit my requirements but this fountain is elegant and cheap enough that I didn't mind.",

    "reviewText": "Didn't realize it was all plastic, that is on me since it says it in the details. I guess you get what you pay for. The design is annoying, you need to make sure you setup the pump level to what works best for you realizing that any level has a hum that you will hear and its not the white noise hum people can sleep to. if you need to make any change then you have to remove all the rocks, pull up the base , empty the water, make your change and put it all back again. the instructions were poorly lit so they are not very helpful and step 4 says the bead light is for another hole, but then doesn't tell you which hole. When you do figure it out, there is nothing for the light to connect to, you will end up having to glue it into the hole but then that means you have to reglue it every time you need to take it apart. I would suggest going to a one of those niche stores and picking one up already assembled that you can inspect before purchase.",

Also, it can be a little noisy if the water level gets too low, but that's a good reminder to add more water, so the pump doesn't burn out. Overall I was pleased with this purchase.",

    "reviewText": "UPDATE: A replacement showed up very quickly. Same packaging, but it was perfect.Very quiet motor. I forgot to look what setting it is on before turning it on. No splash. No water trickling sound, but it might be in low. (Mini update: turned switch on bottom, might have changed the water flow somewhat. However! I added a little stone or two to the top and now as the water runs around the stones I have a water fountain sound! Also, still no splash!)I planned on putting it on a table on the porch. Listing says indoor and outdoor many places. The directions clearly state indoor. It is only a two prong plug.Original review: The tail on the yellow bird was broken. It was shipped only in the privy manufacturer packaging. The box did not look harmed.Wondering if everything was just too tightly packed.The water reservoir was sitting directly on the top of the packaging on the bird. Any downward pressure probably broke it.It‚Äôs pretty. The yellow isn‚Äôt as bright but it almost looks more natural instead of lemon yellow. I liked it. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to plug the new one in and use it.",

    "reviewText": "Gave this to my mom for her birthday to replace a fountain I got her months ago which, while half the price of this one, constantly leaked and had pump issues. So glad I spent the extra money for a higher quality fountain this time! This fountain has never leaked or broken down, it's very pretty and not loud, and it's easy to use & maintain! Great for anyone who likes birds :) I will say if you're looking for a fountain that will produce a lot of running water sounds, this doesn't; it's a small fountain with a small stream of water, so while it's audible, it's quiet. Works well for us, but I know some people find water sounds soothing.",

    "reviewText": "I'm like 90% sure that the unit I received was used/returned because there were water marks on the pieces. I don't really care about that but thought I'd mention it. The gripes I have are that there is a hairline crack across the back side of it and there are some glue spots/flaws in the finish. I'm sure the crack can be sealed, and it's in the back so no one will really see it. The glue spots are likewise fixable.The fountain is easy to set up. You just attach the tube to the pump, set the pump volume with the little lever, pour in your water, place the top piece onto the bowl, press the pump to the bottom of the bowl so the suction cups stick, arrange your rocks, plug it in, and you're off to the races. The pump is quiet and easy to replace if necessary.It makes a nice setting for action figure photos (just don't leave them there or the water might damage them) and can be decorated adorably with colorful glass pieces/beads, non-water-soluble minerals (such as quartz or obsidian), or little glass or ceramic fish/frogs/turtles/birds/etc.Note: in my photos, I have the pump set on medium (the lever is right in the middle)",

I will return unfortunately..Update: On a positive note, I just discovered that if I leave it on, after a while the noise subsides, and it actually sounds the way it should.HOWEVER, I just discovered a huge water mark on my desk underneath where the fountain sat. This thing ruined my desk, unfortunately. While getting it ready to return it, after it dried, I noticed that the bottom had a crack that was attempted to be fixed but it didn't seal properly so it leaked big time. Just so you know, I didn't purchase a refurbished product, or used. It was supposed to be a brand new product. Which came with a poorly fixed crack. I'm not trusting this brand going forward!",

The unit is all ceramic so easy to clean and durable. There is no light which would have added to the serene ambiance and no on/off switch which is convenient but not necessary since the fountain can be left running continuously as long as it is full.",

It's easy to set up - attach the pump and replace the dome. The water evaporates quickly; good for adding humidity in the room but it needs some attention. I add water every day, ~ 1/2 cup, when the pump starts gurgling. Otherwise it is silent when filled. I wanted more of a trickling noise, but not too much, so I added a small rock to the top. That breaks up the flow and makes a quiet trickle. (See video.) I also added more rocks to the bowl, which was larger than I expected.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this water fountain to replace a worn out one I had previously, and it turned out to be the right size for the space, and a wonderful color. But, just to let other people know, it does uses up a lot of water rather quickly, so you have to refill it often. No big deal, all things considered. I like it a lot, and I had to shop all over the place before I finally found this one. I recommend it! And the vendor sent it very quickly, too!",

I was looking for a regular old water wall/fountain and thought I'd give it a try instead. Gotta say there's no instructions whatsoever so it took a little bit to figure everything out but once you get it going it's a neat little setup. Just got it started but I've got some java fern, gold ribbon swordtail, bamboo, pothos and arrowhead vine in there and everything is starting to grow nice. I added some additional lighting to just for the plants which I have everything ran through a timer and it comes on for 7hrs per day. The mist maker gives a pretty cool effect but it leaves moisture around the top of my shelf that it sits on and it's wood so I don't ever leave it on",

    "reviewText": "I bought a used fountain, and when it arrived it didn‚Äôt work. My husband, being a handyman, took it apart and found the issue. A small plastic ring had broken off part of the section that spins to push the water up the fountain. After some superglue and a little sanding, we got it work properly.Even if I had purchased a brand new one, the fountain is very cheaply made and likely won‚Äôt last long. Is it worth $70 for a one time use in your wedding cake or at an event? If your budget allows, sure. Please don‚Äôt purchase expecting a lifetime of use from it. Advice for others: order it early to give adequate time for a return and a new fountain just in case it doesn‚Äôt work.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Bad cable location. Very nice design, relaxing, some mod work required for cords leaking.",
    "reviewText": "Purchased 2 of these to place on opposite sides of my 220 gallon South American Cichlid Aquarium. I must say they blend in nicely and give the ends of the tank that curb appeal it had been missing! I also purchased some fake ivy from a different seller to add to the area as well I will try and link that item. So now on to what seems to be the common thread and only a few people have figured out about the leaking etc. Dealing with very large aquariums and numerous water fountains and other water features I am very aware of how and where many leaks come from, short of there actually being a crack or hole in something water will always find those little unthinkable ways to escape. It appears the leaks are caused by the outlet area for all the cords! As most people will just let cords do the natural flow. There are a min of 4 cords coming out of the back. The solution I found that works is get all the cords together zip the them in 3 places, get some water safe silicone and silicone the rounded out area that is located in the lower left of the pump access door. Then place all 4 cords against the silicone then add a bit more to ensure the cords and fountain are covered with it. I then just installed the pump cover purposely pushing into the silicone to form a seal around the cord area. Using a small 3m adhesive strip/hook I then looped the cords up the back just to make sure water if any would not follow that path. I can tell you this stops the mystery leaking. The cords inside the fountain get dripped on by the led lights especially if the seals for them are not tight. Water then flows along the cords and out causing the leaks! Should consumer's need to do this? Absolutely not but that is what needs to be done! I only put theses in 10 inch planter bottoms to add black rock to match my Aquarium. Overall the water volume is nice and pump is quiet. Shimmering lights effect it gives off is also relaxing. I have found no splashing with these fountains. Having these on timers they run about 16 hours a day I average about adding water once a week that is lost through evaporation!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 15 Month Review + Tips",
    "reviewText": "I've owned this for 15 months. It's been in use almost seven days a week the whole time, often longer than 12 hrs a day, once for 24+ hrs just to see. I bought it to bring life to my small home where my pets are alone for way too long. It's still working like it's brand new and looks that way too. I only clean it monthly and do that by using really hot water and the kitchen sink sprayer along with my finger to check for sliminess inside and in the pools. I've used vinegar but not sure if it made any difference. Other than that, I add a microbe treatment for general protection, available from Amazon: Ecological-Labs-10TTFC4-Microbe-Fountain which is supposed to be safe for people and pets. I know my little ones drink from the fountain and 15 months later everyone is still okay. TIPS: Keep it level to help avoid splashing and possible leaking. Keep it relatively clean to protect the motor and any little ones that will drink from it. Keep it in a 12 inch plant pot or similar pan to catch potential leaks, then make that look pretty. Added benefit of using a plant pot - portable nature scene if you'll need to move it around. Use only mineral free / distilled water (not spring or municipal) to prevent mineral build up that can mess up the motor and discolor the fountain. Fill it directly in one of the pools. So much easier. There is a rim / lip on the lowest pool that you can fill it up to. Any more will get you a mess. This is the amount I filled it to and got over 24 hrs use one day** BUT NOT IN THE HEAT OF SUMMER! Don't let it run dry or the pump will be damaged and likely not work anymore. Takes approximately 1 1/2 quarts to fill, maybe a little more. That's not exact but real close. Get a storage bin: doubles for coverage if it needs to stay semi-outdoors when rain or heavy winds are expected. Mine stays on the porch in the summer and uses more water due to evaporation. The motor is almost soundless. All I hear is the water falling into three pools. Beautiful sound and beautiful to look at if it gets doctored up a bit. Improves every place I've put it in, adds life, comforts my little ones, sort of makes a regular room feel like a destination, and everyone who sees the fountain comments on it. If this dies I'll get another one in a heartbeat.",

    "reviewText": "Read Jeff Thompson's review. He talks about how to set up the cords and silicone the opening to make sure you don't get leaks. It takes a little work, but once you get it set up correctly, it is really wonderful. I also agree with the buyer who said it pumps plenty of water at the lowest pump setting. I took their advice and I'm glad I did. It pumps quite a bit of water at the lowest setting. The lights are perfect, the sound of the water is amazing. I really like it. Here's a few tips: 1. Put it in a container in case it leaks. 2. You can fill the water from the front so seal the bottom part of the back opening with silicone (see picture). 3. The lowest point of the back opening is about 3.5 inches from the bottom. So if you fill the water from the front, get the level to where the water just covers the LED light in the lowest basin. That is about 3 inches from the bottom so it won't be overfilled and the water won't leak out the back. 4. Use a water treatment that is meant to stop bacterial growth and mold. I use one that is meant for swamp coolers and humidifiers. 5. Like others have suggested, use small rocks at the base of each waterfall to change the sound to fit your preference. 6. I took out the black screen on the second tier waterfall because I didn't like the way it looked. After I took it out, I didn't notice any difference in splashing or the flow of water, so I would recommend doing that. I just want to give another special shout-out to Jeff Thompson. I don't know you, but I'm very grateful for your idea on stopping the leaks! I took the time to write my suggestions because Jeff took the time to write his. Overall, after taking the time to get it set up right and making a decorative base for it, I absolutely love this waterfall! It's so relaxing and peaceful. I'm so glad I got it.",

What I like: Appearance of better quality than it actually is, attractive, easy to put together, can't hear the motorWhat I don't like: The water stream is barely audible. Ambient noise will cancel the subtle sound. I had to build up the stones by placing a larger stone on each side of the smaller stones which helped. The stones help highlight the sound as the water trickles through them however, it's a very small water flow with limited space to build the stones up. After all, it's a small item. Best placed in a quiet space.",

The sound is very quiet--alternates between silence and gentle burbles, but you can make it louder or quieter by adjusting the stones the water falls over. The stones that come with it are nothing special. I covered the base with small stones I've gathered over the years, though it also looked nice w/o anything in it. It fits well in the room; not too large, not too small. I felt like I was taking a bit of a chance when I ordered it but I'm really very happy with it. Whoever designed this did a good job.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this for my wife to place next to her Orchids, thinking it would add a little moisture to the ambient air around them. I was very impressed with the quality, and the easy setup. It is important to note that you need to make sure the pump is completely submerged. Anyway, the LED's are awesome but why not put one in every tier?? There are 4 tiers but only 3 LED's. It just looks like it is missing that forth tier and seems like it could have been such an easy thing to include. This is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5.I will fix that 4th tier by adding an LED to that location. There are many aftermarket parts to make that happen. Other than that, it's a wonderful table top feature that works great with a surrounding of plants.ADDITIONALLY: I am normally not happy with about 25% of my Amazon shipping experiences, but this time, I have to say that I am completely happy! I did not think I would get this until at LEAST 5 days later, yet it got to me in two days. THANK YOU! Expected Feb 17th, got Feb 12th!EDIT: I changed my review to 2 stars out of 5. Why? The pump croaked after less than 5 months of use. I figured it would die with continuous use in a year or two, but not after less than 5 months. We only used distilled water, used the water anti-algae drops weekly as-per instructions, and NEVER let it go dry. As a matter of fact, because of evaporation, I checked it every day to make sure it was full. So since it croaked, I decided to do to it what I wanted to anyway. Put an after-market pump in it, and redo the LED feature. After all, I was always irritated that not all the tiers were lit.EDIT 2ND: The customer service is very good. I had a response to my complaint email within one business day, and had a pump shipped and received within 4 business days free because of the warranty. Our feature is working great again, which is why I bumped the rating back to 4 stars.",

Cleaning it well is a bit of a challenge due to the shape, but it is doable. I am still incredibly pleased with this product. It continues to look beautiful and every part remains fully functional, from the pump to the lights.I‚Äôve been using this fountain for the past three days, and I am loving it. The sounds of water flowing are exactly what I was looking for, the style is perfect, and the splash is minimal to none (on the highest flow setting). Set up was simple, and the lights are beautiful at night as they cast shimmering and dancing water ripples across the wall and ceiling. I am extremely pleased with this item, and I put in hours of research, looking at over 30 fountains to decide between, and I am very happy I chose this one. I will update after a few months use (if I remember!).",

    "reviewText": "Beautiful sound like water over rocks in a stream to me. Is well made. Lights are not so bright you can't run it and go to sleep by it. You can also buy a few glass rocks to put over them to dim them if needed. Easy to set up. My concern was if I could ever easily replace the water pump if it went out and from what I can tell in the inside of the fountain you can. Just get a new one likely online or from the advice of their customer service people. The user Manuel it came with didn't match the fountain style but the set up is pretty easy. You just plug in the power cord silver attachment to the cord end match inside the back of the fountain. But not yet to an outlet. Then add water so the pump is covered completely over the top of it with water and there is enough for the fountain in general. I put my fountain in a deep tray first so if I blew it in water amount it would catch it. Then PLUG in the fountain for it to come on. Water flow speed is on the side of the small water pump inside the back of the fountain. Then once I was set, I drained the extra water off of the tray I had to keep the fountain dry on the bottom. The only bad thing on this fountain is it doesn't have an on or off switch for it only the plug. So I like to use what I call a tack strip or a multi outlet strip and surge protector with an on or off switch on it. It works fine so far long as that is all I keep on that strip plugged in.",

The pump is just as prominent as the water. But also reminds me of a fish tank sound. I will post a video.",

I am sensitive to any noises, and wanted to focus on the soothing water sounds more than vibrations of the motor. They could easily redesign this with that added sound absorption, but either way it's worth the buy and brings good vibes into ur home!",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Bought this to compliment another fountain I have in my living room (love the first one but wanted them to coordinate rather than match) and absolutely love it! It‚Äôs easy to set up, the pump is quiet, and the sound is relaxing and loud enough to be heard across the room.Water level and cord placement has a significant affect on pump noise, so if yours is too loud make sure it‚Äôs as full as possible (without overflowing) and/or try moving the cord around until you find the quietest placement.Rock placement has a big affect on ‚Äútrickle‚Äù sound. If you don‚Äôt care for the sound you‚Äôre getting try rearranging the rocks under the flow of water.The only drawback is that there‚Äôs no on/off switch on the fountain or cord - it has to be plugged in every time to turn on and unplugged to turn off. This seems to be standard for these little tabletop fountains. I solved this problem by using an Amazon smart plug and controlling it with Alexa.",

    "reviewText": "Not perfect but then you wouldn‚Äôt expect it to be for the price. Seller was nice. Don‚Äôt expect to have the water falls fall in a perfect V shape forever. They might but mine didn‚Äôt. But I tell myself it looks more natural this way, like it would fall in cave. Lights are still working months later. Really warm color, nice at night, relaxing sound. Big tips: place this fountain on a piece of foam like you find in some shipping boxes, or another vibration absorptive material. The fountain gave off a hum when I first placed it down, but after putting a layer of foam between it and the surface, it is silent now except for the water sounds which are relaxing. Hooked it up to a smart switch, can control with my voice! Very cool. Also be sure to have a bottle of water you keep full nearby because whether due to evaporation or splashing, water does leave this thing at an alarming rate, so expect to top it up once a week or so if you‚Äôre using it regularly. Got a sand crystal on top of mine ‚Äî I call it my Sun Temple. Reminds me of Mayans. I know I also have good taste in cars. Enjoy!",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The motor is very quiet.",
    "reviewText": "Likes:The motor is very quiet, it looks really nice, it works well, the added pot for a small plant is cool, the price is reasonable (paid $40 for it), the power cord is decently long, water doesn't splash.Dislikes:I really don't want the light on and there is not a switch to turn it on and off. I'm pretty sensitive to light. It's a small light but even if I just look at the fountain for a few seconds, not at the light itself but just the fountain in general, and look at something else after, I can still see that light. It'd be nice if there a switch or if we could dim it or have different colors for it. When I have more time, I'll have to figure how to disconnect the light adapter.The only other detail I don't like is that you have to unplug the electrical cord from the outlet/power strip to turn it on and off. I'll probably end up attaching it to a smart plug to control it on and off without having to routinely unplug and re-plug it. The power cord could've been made so that it was two pieces with an on/off switch so that 1) You can easily turn it on and off without having to plug and re-plug and 2) When it is time to clean and/or refill, it would be easier to disconnect and reconnect.Preferences:The water could be louder, which is the reason why I got it in the first place -- the sound of water is very calming to me and genuinely makes me feel happier; but that's a personal preference and not on them. I'll probably experiment with some small stones to see if I can get the sound a little bit louder. If you try the same just make sure that you're careful to not block the hole, are mindful of possible splashing and mindful of not overfilling the water tank.Additionally, if you do not plan on using that spot made for an actual plant, you can use different colors of dye to change the color of the water. That's also another reason why I think it would be cool if we could change the light color so it's not just white; at least made it amber. White is just a boring light color for a product like this. Now that I am thinking about it, dying the water a different color could also lessen the light as well.Overall:5/5, easily. It's easily a good product for the price and do recommend. If it had been more, say around $60, I would've given it a 4 due to the power cord and not being able to adjust the light by turning it on and off. Regardless, I would've still recommended it anyway. I also like that I was able to get it with Prime quickly. Also a really good bonus üëç",

    "reviewText": "Lovely little item, truly.I don‚Äôt understand why people complain about the water noise or splashing, all you have to do is place pebbles where the water pours and then no more noise or splashing.Leave top bowl (level 3) alone.Leave middle bowl (level 2) alone, place one of the larger rocks where the water from this bowl hits the platform.Bottom bowl with light (Level 1), if you want to remove the sound where water from level 3 drops into the lighted level 1 bowl, place a rock leaning against the orange light in the bowl where the water from the level 3 bowl lands and that will stop the splashing sound.If you line up the pebbles against the edge of the platform you will also cut down any noise from the motor.You can top off the water by pouring it into the little hole in the back, where the power cord is supposed to come out of the water pump.... so you don‚Äôt have to remove the platform to do that. However, it is tedious to once a week clean the item. You have to remove the pebbles to fully clean it and then have to replace them when done. If you use clear not hard water, you can clean it every few weeks rather than once a week..NOTE: Make sure you run it hard during the first few weeks so if there is a pump problem, you can return it to amazon. I did wind up having a pump issue and THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok, so 3 mos later I can give a more realistic review. The cotton cord for the plant is insufficient, so even with additional watering when I refilled it (2x/wk), the plant is as dead as a doornail. The pump is sketchy, so what began as a lovely trickling sound took on a rhythmic dumping sound that's irritating, not soothing. And finally, the best part of all - the body of it developed a slow leak and we didn't catch it until it completely ruined the wood table it was on. So overall, it starts off looking good & ends in a sloppy mess less than 3 months later. So I'd have to call it garbage & a waste if money. Very disappointed.I absolutely love the self watering planted feature. I picked up a little fairy garden plant, added water, plugged it in & it was good to go! It has a nice relaxing water sound, doesn't splash and the appearance is lovely.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Beautiful!",
    "reviewText": "I understand that reviews are subject to individual perspectives and experiences so I keep that in mind whenever I am buying a product. This beautiful fountain checks off just about all the boxes for me. When it first arrived and I looked at the size of the box I thought to myself, this is really small. However once I put it together and on top of my table, it was absolutely perfect! I received all of the items new and in prefect condition, there were no broken or missing pieces. While it came with instructions it really wasn't necessary, it was so very simple to put together and it took me less than 3 minutes and I had the water flowing and everything working. I was grateful to the reviews that mention using distilled water instead of tap water in order to prolong pump life, so I bought and added distilled water before starting it. I was looking for a fountain that could give me gentle water sounds, that did not have that spinning orb (as I don't like them), that had the soft glow of yellow warm looking led lights and a quiet pump. This fountain had all of that. The only downside was it does not have an on/off switch, but a lot of them don't and I don't mind connecting and disconnecting the fountain. This fountain is just as beautiful and peaceful sounding in the day as it is the night. I can't predict how long it will last as I've only been running it since I received it 4 days ago in increments of a couple of hours in a 24 hour period, but so far it's perfect. I have the peaceful water sounds and no motor sounds. They include a bag of rocks to go around the base, I tried them in different locations till I got what for me was the perfect water sound, as you can see they're scattered around the base with a few of them piled right under where the water flows from the last bottom bowl. I look forward to morning and evenings when I go out to my back porch to look at the plentiful wildlife and listen to the relaxing sounds of my fountain. I love this fountain so much, I will most likely get another one for my meditation corner.",

    "reviewText": "If you don't mind it splattering a little bit, this is a nice fountain. It's a case of the pump not quite being matched to the capacity of the fountain, so you will want to turn it to the minimum speed. Also, a couple of things that aren't mentioned in the instructions... It may seem strange, but your electric cable for the LED light will be underwater. Just be sure and screw the connector on tightly to help it be waterproof. Also the purpose of the sponge isn't mentioned. It shows where the sponge sits, but doesn't say if it's only for packing, or meant to be there while operating the fountain. I found the sound so disagreeable if it was in place while the fountain was operating, that I pulled it out.From past experience with fountains, you will want to follow the advice of cleaning it every week because mold will probably build up in the reservoir just above the water line. Also, even though I use distilled water, there is enough stuff in the air, that eventually slime will start to grow in it if not cleaned regularly.If you keep these things in mind, you will have a very pretty, gurgling fountain to grace your table.",

I can't hear the pump at all.I recommend using distilled water instead of tap water as you won't get any of that white calcium buildup and it will prolong the life of the fountain.If this breaks in a few years, I'll 100% buy another one.",

    "reviewText": "This fountain is definitely pretty to look at but assembling the pump is a pain in the rear. It took a while but I finally got it working, I had almost given up though. You have to fill it pretty often if you plan to leave it running all the time. Also the way you turn it on is to just plug it in, there's no on/off switch. If the outlet you're using isn't easily accessible it turns into you not wanting to turn it on at all, especially if you have to move furniture or stoop to plug/unplug it. A simple switch on the cord would be a HUGE improvement.",

    "reviewText": "First, this is a beautiful fountain made of resin and it's fairly heavy as well. I got it for use next to my desk in my office. It looks lovely there and it's very quiet while running.It was difficult to get the pump inside it, however. I like that the little light part was already connected, but the pump has to be connected and placed inside a very small space. I found this pretty hard to do and it took more than one try.The other thing I think would have been great is to have an on/off switch. This has to be plugged in to work and unplugged to stop. I will have to move it from beside my desk because I can't crawl under the desk every day .Other than these small inconveniences, this is a lovely fountain and so peaceful. It makes me smile and quiets my heart watching it.All in all, it's a good purchase. I would give this item as a gift as well.",

She had it hooked up and running in less than 10 minutes. Not only does the fountain work very well, but the light looks great at night. The sound of the water is very soothing. The only negative is a lack of an on/off switch, so you have to unplug it in order to turn it off. But I solved that problem by connecting it to a smart plug, so I can turn it on or off with my phone.",

    "reviewText": "This indoor tabletop water fountain is attractive and relaxing. The fountain comes with a pump and crystal ball on top. The fountain looks beautiful with four tiers made of stones and a bottom layer to recycle the water. The fountain was simple to set up, taking minutes to assemble, and began working after adding water and plugging it in.The LED light adds a nice ambiance, but it's just one colour. The addition of a clear, glass ball on the top tier creates a mesmerizing effect as it spins with the flow of water, reflecting light beautifully. The pump operates quietly in the background. On the downside, it is a bit pricey for a small tabletop fountain. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a charming and relaxing water fountain to add to their home decor.",

He begs us to turn on the bathroom faucet so he can drink from it. He avoids the water bowl and even the cat fountain. He won‚Äôt drink from this fountain either, so we are still trying to find the right fit for him, but I love this little fountain. I keep it in our guest powder room which has no windows. Thus the light on the fountain looks really pretty and guides guests to it. I love the sound of the trickling water also. I keep a gallon bottle of distilled water in the cabinet so that I can fill it regularly.",

I filled it how I usually do, Put distilled water in the base, start pump and pour water into the water outlet and then unplug, let it sit for 10seconds and then plug in, no noise and pumps well. Also lots of stones I usually have enough for one layer this had some spares that could go on top and add some depth.Overall ,Great product and some tweaks could make it feel more premium but over all suits my needs and sounds good.",

Also, although it has pretty lights, it makes no trickling noise whatsoever, so it's not that soothin--borderline pointless.",

And that didn't guarantee the water would flow properly either. I even cut my finger once. For other fountains I've had before, you could easily lift the top to clean and replace the water with ease. Maintaining a fountain should not be this effortful and difficult. In the end, I donated it to Goodwill because it was simply too time-consuming and frustrating for me.

It looks a little less prestine than the first to be honest, but it works great! They may have forgotten the tree part, but I was able to take the one off the defective previous fountain. So now it's complete. :)11/8/23: I literally just set this fountain up on my desk and then immediately had a lake of leaking water on my desk. This is not okay. This is something that should be tested before shipment. I now have fish arriving in the mail today and nothing to put them in. I'm pissed. 11/13/23: And then on top of that, it takes them forever just to send a replacement because they don't tell you upfront that you have to return the product before they can ship the replacement. That's not usually how Amazon returns work. Products are supposed to be sent in good faith that the damaged product gets returned by the return date. This is absurd.",

    "reviewText": "My child had been asking for a desktop fountain and after looking at many options, he chose this one. The rolling ball is really cool, especially since it is lit up from below. The fountain came with good instructions, which made for easy set up. The mister is really cool to watch, but results in the whole counter getting wet as the mist settles, which is a little bit of a problem since ours is sitting on a wooden bookshelf. Luckily the mister has a separate power source, so our solution is to just turn it on for a little bit and then unplug it. The fountain is well made and worth the price. The motor is not noisy and the trickling of water is a nice ambient sound. My child often turns it on before bed and falls asleep to the sound.One more comment - the picture shows what appear to be live fish in the fountain. This fountain would definitely not be a good long term home for fish. As a fish owner, this is pretty obvious and I told my kid going in that we would not actually be able to put fish inside, but if you didn't know much about fish, the picture might be deceiving.",

For the few minutes it worked it was very pretty. I will be getting a better pump and hope it works. As it came from the US I see it a waste of time trying to return it. EARLIER COMMENTS : I cant review yet on how it works as a fountain but felt a heads up is needed in the write up as in the UK we need to get adapters to use two pin plugs. So I will be going to find one tomorrow. It seems a nice well made item and is not plasticky looking like some of these items can be.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Strong Pump. Easy to clean",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My previous solar fountain died when it was just over one year old. I looked at the reviews for several of the offerings by Amazon and chose this one mostly because of its simplicity and low price. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to disassemble for cleaning. Unlike most of the others, it is possible to remove the rotor from the pump motor, thus enabling it's cleaning as well.The pump is quite a performer! It produces a stream around three feet high with the single opening tube. The problem with that is the fountain must be refilled several times a day if there is any wind. I found that using just the straight tube with no attachments provides plenty of water motion and limits water loss to that caused by evaporation - and what the birds splash out! I suspect that all that power could produce a more attractive display in a larger fountain.I have only had it for a month so cannot testify to its longevity, though I suspect it will exceed those without the motor disassembly feature.The majority of the accompanying video was shot on an overcast day. That makes it appear as though the cleaning did not have much effect. I assure you, it does. The pump does require strong light to work. As can also be seen in the video, it just kind of burps in low light. In fact, it sometimes stops completely when the whole surface is shaded. That is OK for my purpose, which is mostly to provide water and bathing for the birds without worrying about mosquitos.",

    "reviewText": "We bought this to squirt water into the air in our bird bath in an effort to cool the H2O (Florida, temp right now 98 degrees and increasing). It squirts great! For a simple and very inexpensive little gadget it does its job perfectly. NOTE that it does NOT charge its battery (if it even has one?). It takes electricity from the solar cell and uses it to IMMEDIATELY pump -- no sun? no electricity and no pump! But, hay, what do you want for under $15? It does need sun, not just light so not so much pumping at sunrise and sunset (certainly not at night!). Oh Yeah, when its really hot, the temp of our water is still somewhat warm so our great idea of using the fountain to cool the bird water was somewhat of a bust. Ain't science a kick?",

However, I regret the purchase and do not recommend unless you live in a place that is always sunny.- The fountain will not work unless it is in FULL sun, hence, it will not work in the shade of a tree or an overcast day. I added a video to show what it does on a cloudy day, it gurgles. The fountain doesn‚Äôt charge like some of my other solar items. I wanted to put it right under a tree branch for the birds because they prefer to come down for a drink and fly back to a tree for safety. I‚Äôm unable to use the fountain as I wanted.- If the sun comes and goes, the fountain does too. The water will spurt out the top.- I did appreciate the little plastic straws that help keep the fountain in the center.- The water has to be at least 2 inches deep to allow the fountain to work. If working as stated, the fountain will shoot too high and it ends up splashing water out of the birdbath. Maybe it would work better with something deeper than what I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôm constantly having to fill up the bath.- My birdbath was a happening place until I put the fountain in. Enough said.",

Creates a nice pattern, and there‚Äôs plenty to choose from. Easy to assemble and choosing a spray is easy and fun, using the glossary and testing it out.* note* the fountain works instantly! That‚Äôs great, but it also doesn‚Äôt store energy, so no spray at night (or I assume on dark days). For all the above I give it 5 stars. However, here‚Äôs the problem I couldn‚Äôt overcome:This is a free floating device. The spray moves it around the birdbath, and it inherently stays next to the side, causing half the spray to land outside the birdbath until it drained all the water! I tried fixing the gizzy to various items, but never was successful. Maybe something could be epoxied onto the birdbath for gizzy to be adhered to. For you crafty types and for this cheap price, maybe you can figure it out. I gave up and put my St. Anthony statue in the birdbath instead.",

My plan was to plant flowers along the perimeter of a large pot, then put a smaller pot in the middle for the fountain. Unfortunately, the pot I used is too small in diameter (8‚Äù), so all the water splashes out of the pot and it runs out of water too quickly. It even splashes over the side of the larger pot on the bottom, which is 14‚Äù in diameter. I went through 1.5 gallons of water in about 1/2 hour. I‚Äôm bummed this is so impractical because it looked so good. I‚Äôm going to see if I can find something wide enough to contain the water so it can be reused instead of splashing out.",

    "reviewText": "The instructions are clear and easy to follow. As soon as I put the fountain together and walked with it into the sun, it automatically turned on and I could feel it vibrating. When I placed it in my birdbath, which is under an orange tree and mostly shaded, it began to spout water about six or seven inches into the air approximately once every two and-a-half seconds. So far, it is working well given the partial sunlight. IN FULL SUNLIGHT, WATER WILL CONTINUALLY SPOUT UP AT LEAST TWO FEET HIGH WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. The only question is how long will it last. I rinse and refill my birdbath daily so clogging should be minimal. So far, it IS definitely worth the money. As others have said, the more direct the sunlight, the better.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So an update about eight months later. For $10 I didn‚Äôt expect them to last that long, so eight months is about what I expected. I went with a little different solar model that has the bubblers instead to see how those work betterSo just an update after owning it for a couple months and it continuously being on in my 30 gallon horse trough. I‚Äôve only had to scrub out the trough once in two months from algae. Prior it would be at least every 10 days. Pretty amazed at this little item. As others have stated, this does not have a battery where it retains power overnight, but for 10 bucks what do you want? Long as it has light and it doesn‚Äôt even necessarily have to be direct sunlight, it works to some extent. I keep it on medium to low where the fountain works just well enough so the water is not stagnant. Buying another one for my other animal water trough. I‚Äôve read were others have had issues with it getting clogged, as long as you keep as long as you keep contaminants out of the water you will not have that issue. The only time I got clogged is when there were some algae in the trough that I needed a scrub it out, a little bit got in the water holes. Very easy to clean out, just took a stiff plastic brush and poked it in the little holes and it was good as new. Wiped off the solar ‚Äúpanels‚Äú and worked as well as the first day. I don‚Äôt think this fountain has the rating it should have overall, I‚Äôm sure there are some duds out there just like there is in any other product but for $10 I really do like this item. I think too many people are expecting it to store like a battery to charge for overnight. Again it‚Äôs 10 bucks.So I was a little skeptical about this little solar fountain for $10 being all that. I was surprised though, it actually had power coming out of the box. I use it in my 30 gallon horse trough not a birdbath, just enough oxygen into the water where the algae won‚Äôt grow so fast. In the video I have it on medium flow. It does require sunlight obviously being solar, but even when it‚Äôs cloudy, It‚Äôs given about half flow. so far very impressed , well worth a $10 investment",

    "reviewText": "Works great in my birdbath! I wish the 4 centering pegs were attached better, I took off one star for that - some large birds ended up removing them from the fountain and I had to look for them in my yard a couple times. There isn't a good way to glue them on either. Some of the reviewers mentioned this product stops working - and I did experience that a couple times when the birdbath went dry. I brought it inside, cleaned the filter material, and then took it back outside in the sun where I had to shake it quite a few times vigorously until I could feel it working again. As long as the birdbath had water, the product worked well when the sun was out. Another note: I could only use the downward flowing fountain attachment, all the other attachments caused the water to shoot outside the birdbath. But that was fine - I just wanted water movement in the bird bath, and this did the job.",

    "reviewText": "This solar-powered fountain works great in my pedestal bird bath -- it does need direct sunlight to function well. When the sun rays are coming at an angle, the motor will work intermittently. With direct rays, the fountain sprays quite high (greater than 12 inches). To decrease the power of the spray, I put a very small rock on one panel section and it worked perfectly to bring the water spray down to 3 or 4 inches. Just enough to attract the attention of birds, but not enough to cause water to splash out of the bird bath.Tip: Clean out your bird bath every evening, give the fountain pump a rinse and allow to air dry (solar panel side down) and refill bird bath with fresh water in the morning. This will prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs in the water, plus keeping the water fresh and clean prevents the pump motor from clogging up.I have had my fountain pump over 2 months now and it is still working just fine.",

    "reviewText": "My wife had been asking me for a bird water bath or a feeder for our back deck. I saw this on Tiktok and it look interesting. Because of the price being so low I was a bit skeptical. I ordered it anyway and we were quite surprised how well it works. As soon as the sun touches the top, the motor starts running so you always need to make sure it's in water or it will burn out. The only thing we don't like about it is that the water always splashes outside of the container which means you end up having to fill up the container a lot. Unless you have it inside a very large container that I will catch the water. Also if there's a bit a wind it will cause the water to spill out causing your container to run out of water. So I gave it 5 stars because it does work good as long as there is sun and the water remains full. Not something to leave out if it's windy or more more than a couple of days.",

I easily snipped off the ends of the 4 \"holders that keep it in place to fit the bird bath - no problem. The fountain part works perfectly. The water doesn't splash out of the birdbath much at all (I was worried about it doing that, but it hasn't been a problem). It works even in cloudy weather, the fountain just sometimes only burbles or doesn't shoot up as high. I'm very happy with that. The water is still moving and the birds love it. It has even attracted a couple of new species to my feeders. So happy with this product at this point! I would highly recommend this product. It brings a lot of relaxation and pleasure for the price.",

Seller offered full refund, when I declined offer due to device not being defective, seller still refunded money due to not being 100% satisfied with product.Purchased this with excitement for my bird bath and quickly realized it's not quite functional. The product does work, has many different spout options for different flow opoptions. I like the solar power, very easy to set up and use. As you can see with the pics/videos I have had to find things to secure the fountain in the middle of the bird bath so it doesn't spray all the water out.",

The arms tend to fall off whenever handled or cleaning out your bird bath. The attachments are great however the pump is pretty strong and unless you have a large fountain or pond, the water shoots up too high and the wind blows the water away from landing back in your bird bath. Had to use one of the weaker attachments and didn't get the water trickle sound I was looking for. Overall, this product has a short life span in my experience.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After trying the various nozzles, we ended having to go without since the slightest breeze would cause the water to go outside of the bird bath draining it in a matter of minutes. The pump only works in full to partial sun. At first we thought we got a defective pump since it would spurt every so often but became a steady stream in full sun. Since the bird bath was installed over where a bush used to be we took advantage of the existing irrigation line and use it to fill the bath each morning with fresh water to replace the water that evaporated in the hot Arizona sun. Only time will tell how long the solar pump will last but it so cheap I‚Äôd be okay with buying a new one every year if needed.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I really like this solar powered bird bath fountain pump. It works really well in direct sunlight. Let's get to some pros and cons of this solar fountain pump. I will try to include a video and some pictures. Pros: (1)-Works great in constant direct sun. (2)-No batteries needed. (3)-Its gorgeous and the birds loves it. (4)-It comes with everything you need including 5 different water spray nozzle patterns & plastic straw like support beams to keep it centered in the middle of the bird bath which keeps it from moving around. Cons: (1)-The water splashes everywhere especially if it's windy outside. (2)-You will need to refill the bird bath bowl with water every few hours because the water dissipates from the bird bath really quickly. The reason? Refer back to con #1. (3)-It was a little pricey but I would buy this again if I had a large fountain or a pool in my backyard. (4)-These solar fountain pumps is ideal for a pool or a large fountain because the water will deplete every few hours in a very small bird bath like the one I have in my backyard. (5)-Must have direct sunlight for it to work. No sunlight üåû no working fountain. They are fun to watch, but just make sure you put it in a pool or a large bird bath or water fountain if you don't want to refill a small bird bath fountain bowl every few hours.

I am satisfied and have already ordered another one. I feel that for the minimal price 1 year of solid use is pretty good. I use it in a bird bath and they love it!I used 3m dual lock to stick this fountain dead center in my bird bath and it's a nice addition. It comes with several tips for different water patterns. I ended up just using the smallest tip with the single spray. The smaller tip helps keep the water in the bowl and it also doesn't scare the birds. They flop around in the water on hot days. There's no battery. If the sun is out it will run. If the sun is not out it is off. I've now had it for 6 months with no problems.",

    "reviewText": "First, when I received this, it was missing the instructions, missing the piece that keeps it centered, and only came with 2 nozzles. It's pretty straight forward. You find a bright sunny location and submerge it in water and it starts working. That was awesome! I don't know why I didn't get one sooner. However, it was pretty frustrating trying to figure out how to keep it centered so that the the water didn't splash out everywhere. I had to refill it with water atleast twice a day. And because I've had other submersible pumps, I know how quickly they can get clogged. I couldn't figure out how to get the motor open to clean it out, because no instructions, and I didn't want to break it. But I did the best I could making sure it was cleaned out, daily or every other day. This pump totally stopped functioning within 2 weeks! I made sure the panel was clean so that it could receive full sun. There was nothing, that I could see blocking the motor. This was during a busy time for me and I missed the return window. I contacted the manufacturer through Amazon, with no response from them. So now I've wasted money on a pump that was probably a return, and doesn't work. Great concept. Just don't buy this one!",

Despite keeping it full of water, cleaning the bowl to prevent any algae or debris buildup and it being shaded for part of each day (decreased workload), it was dead by late August after delivery in early July. Very disappointed as this is outside the return window, and I did read reviews before buying. So - hopefully this will at least benefit others who are considering a purchase.",

    "reviewText": "This item was easy to assemble. My only struggle was that the plastic pipes were a fraction of a bit long and did not fit snugly in my newly purchased water plate/bowl for Birds. Although the plastic stabilizer pipes are retractable and extendable, which is a great feature, I wonder If I can either cut it to size for a proper fit or if there is an option to purchase smaller size pipes? At the present time the item floats only at the very edge of the water bowl, I have to pour water in the bowl at least 2-3 times a day to keep the water level up to the edge for good function. Other than that, this is a good item. It worked as per its instruction booklet. I like all the various fountain options. Very satisfying to watch. So far only one bird has shown interest in drinking the water and taking a bath in the water plate/bowl. Easy to clean. I recommend cleaning the filter at least once in two weeks. Efficient item. Thank you.",

    "reviewText": "I opened the package and there were so many parts. But all we needed were the base and one or two other pieces for a basic fountain. All the variations will probably never be used. The sticks to keep the disk stable is not useful because after a while the water level goes down due to spillage and evaporation and then the fountain doesn't work though the motor keeps going. Better to just let it float according to the level. I thought the mesh that come with it will be useful to keep out debris, but there are no instructions on how to use it. I have to refill the water every day. But the good thing is that the aeration during the day keeps the water from getting murky. Adding water is enough. I have been enjoying it for a week. I hope it lasts.I took off one star for unnecessary parts, packaging and poor instructions.",

I filled the bird bath with water until it almost overflowed and I set the fountain on the lowest setting inside which auto entered with the plastic arms. After 45 minutes the bird bath was empty. So I placed the fountain in a water trough that holds 10 gallons of water. 2 hours later the trough was half empty. I filled it to the top and again hours later the water was low. I‚Äôm surprised that much water evaporated so quickly. The fountain is now in the garage not being used. Nothing wrong with this product it just requires way too much effort to keep functional",

    "reviewText": "We wanted a small bubbler fountain to keep near a hummingbird feeder on our deck, but we lacked an electrical outlet nearby. I had my doubts as to whether the solar fountain actually would work, but it works really well whenever there's sun. It kind of spurts in stutters, or slows to a very low burble, when the sun is obscured by clouds or trees, and as the sun approaches the horizon, but no matter; the water flow has been enough to make itself known to the birds and squirrels in our yard. The squirrels use the fountain regularly, and it has been fun to watch them trying to figure out and trust the fountain, as it \"dims\" whenever a squirrel bends its head over the fountain to take a sip. They've figured it out and trust it now. For us humans, the sight and sound of flowing water is a pleasant, cooling addition to the \"deck experience.\"We put our solar fountain in a 12\" Hanizi Deck-Mounted bowl (also from Amazon), which is the PERFECT size and configuration for Mademax fountain. The solar fountain works as a plain burbler if no flow attachments are used. However, 4 easily-changed attachments are included to change the flow/fountain pattern. We are backyard bird-watchers, and have been for 5 or 6 years now. We'd always heard that a fresh, flowing water source was the most effective way to attract birds to one's yard -- even more so than bird feeders. We've always kept a clean bird bath available, but it holds still water, as a fountain in the bird bath would get continuously clogged by bird droppings, leaves, and feathers. Perhaps it was merely coincidence, but since we added the solar fountain on the deck (which is visible from the sky and the trees in the area), we've greatly increased the number of birds coming to our feeders. Doves are the only birds that actually drink from the fountain (probably because the proximity of humans keeps other species away), but the flowing water is like billboard to passing birds that our yard is a promising dining spot. I replace the water in the fountain every morning, and it needs to be refilled midday (we live in the very hot SE U.S.), but the deck and fountain are right outside our kitchen, so that's no problem for us. We were snickering at ourselves for even considering a solar fountain, but have commented to one another quite a few times how glad we are that we got the Mademax fountain and Hanizi bowl.",

As all of us need a drink. Fountain sprays are nice and have different heads for different patterns. Very cute economical way to add beauty to your garden.

    "reviewText": "The product initially came defective so I requested a replacement. The replacement came 6 days later and worked beautifully. The instructions were poor, but it was easy to figure out. The problem I had was not the fault of the product. Each sprayer worked beautifully and looked great, but 3,5w was simply too much for my 17‚Äù wide, 3‚Äù deep bath. Set on the lowest spray setting and using the head that did not go high was even too much. 5 mph wind on a sunny day blew the water out of the bath leaving nothing in the bowl within 2 hours. The only one that worked without spitting the water out of the bowl was the bubbler. Additionally, the first and replacement set did not come with the pieces described and pictured, although I did like the ones it came with, you may not. It did not have the high center tube. The birds were attracted to all the spray settings. The instructions lacked a description of how and when to clean the filter, which is an important piece of information. I‚Äôll keep this one, but will order a different brand in the future.",

Even when the sun is obscured by clouds, the pump will still work, although not as strongly as in the sunlight. The 3 arms can be positioned easily, and prove to be very helpful in keeping the fountain in the middle of the birdbath, which helps keep the water from spraying out over the sides. The battery has lasted the entire 4 months I've owned the fountain. I would definitely buy this again and would highly recommend.",

    "reviewText": "The product came with a number of different fountain nozzles that added to the experience. However and in my case where I had placed it the sun did not shine on the product as is required. Taking it out of the bird bath and placing it in direct sunlight made the product work very well. Unfortunately, the birdbath was in a specific spot that could not be changed in regard to our Landscaping, so I had to return it. I really like all of the different nozzle features and the force of the water when it was in direct sunlight but again it just did not work out for me. I would recommend purchasing this product if you have a good sun lite location. I also liked the arms that allowed the product to float in the middle of the bird bath.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Strong Pump. Easy to clean",
    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My previous solar fountain died when it was just over one year old. I looked at the reviews for several of the offerings by Amazon and chose this one mostly because of its simplicity and low price. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to disassemble for cleaning. Unlike most of the others, it is possible to remove the rotor from the pump motor, thus enabling it's cleaning as well.The pump is quite a performer! It produces a stream around three feet high with the single opening tube. The problem with that is the fountain must be refilled several times a day if there is any wind. I found that using just the straight tube with no attachments provides plenty of water motion and limits water loss to that caused by evaporation - and what the birds splash out! I suspect that all that power could produce a more attractive display in a larger fountain.I have only had it for a month so cannot testify to its longevity, though I suspect it will exceed those without the motor disassembly feature.The majority of the accompanying video was shot on an overcast day. That makes it appear as though the cleaning did not have much effect. I assure you, it does. The pump does require strong light to work. As can also be seen in the video, it just kind of burps in low light. In fact, it sometimes stops completely when the whole surface is shaded. That is OK for my purpose, which is mostly to provide water and bathing for the birds without worrying about mosquitos.",

    "reviewText": "We bought this to squirt water into the air in our bird bath in an effort to cool the H2O (Florida, temp right now 98 degrees and increasing). It squirts great! For a simple and very inexpensive little gadget it does its job perfectly. NOTE that it does NOT charge its battery (if it even has one?). It takes electricity from the solar cell and uses it to IMMEDIATELY pump -- no sun? no electricity and no pump! But, hay, what do you want for under $15? It does need sun, not just light so not so much pumping at sunrise and sunset (certainly not at night!). Oh Yeah, when its really hot, the temp of our water is still somewhat warm so our great idea of using the fountain to cool the bird water was somewhat of a bust. Ain't science a kick?",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I gave this product 3 stars because it does work as the description states. However, I regret the purchase and do not recommend unless you live in a place that is always sunny.- The fountain will not work unless it is in FULL sun, hence, it will not work in the shade of a tree or an overcast day. I added a video to show what it does on a cloudy day, it gurgles. The fountain doesn‚Äôt charge like some of my other solar items. I wanted to put it right under a tree branch for the birds because they prefer to come down for a drink and fly back to a tree for safety. I‚Äôm unable to use the fountain as I wanted.- If the sun comes and goes, the fountain does too. The water will spurt out the top.- I did appreciate the little plastic straws that help keep the fountain in the center.- The water has to be at least 2 inches deep to allow the fountain to work. If working as stated, the fountain will shoot too high and it ends up splashing water out of the birdbath. Maybe it would work better with something deeper than what I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôm constantly having to fill up the bath.- My birdbath was a happening place until I put the fountain in. Enough said.",

    "reviewText": "This fountain is powerful (like the Texas Sun where I am)! I didn‚Äôt have any cloudy days when I tested it, sorry. I‚Äôve no complaints on the powerful spray itself. Creates a nice pattern, and there‚Äôs plenty to choose from. Easy to assemble and choosing a spray is easy and fun, using the glossary and testing it out.* note* the fountain works instantly! That‚Äôs great, but it also doesn‚Äôt store energy, so no spray at night (or I assume on dark days). For all the above I give it 5 stars. However, here‚Äôs the problem I couldn‚Äôt overcome:This is a free floating device. The spray moves it around the birdbath, and it inherently stays next to the side, causing half the spray to land outside the birdbath until it drained all the water! I tried fixing the gizzy to various items, but never was successful. Maybe something could be epoxied onto the birdbath for gizzy to be adhered to. For you crafty types and for this cheap price, maybe you can figure it out. I gave up and put my St. Anthony statue in the birdbath instead.",

This newer one, I was able to use what I think is the more challenging attachments to make the higher reaching fountain spray design and it worked very well, even on a cloudy day, so it is a great addition because it works better than older models. I would recommend getting it if you like to use floating solar fountains, they are improving as time goes along.",

    "reviewText": "The birds love these little fountains in their bird bath, or in the pond. The only issue is it is quite windy where I am and the wind will push them to the side so that they are spraying out of the bath or pond. Easy fix though, I just hung a heavy washer from the bottom as an anchor and they work perfectly now. The plus is no batteries or wires, they are completely solar so on a real cloudy day they do not spray quite as high, but they work, and at night they shut down so you are not wearing out parts. Also very easy to clean when debris get sucked into the pump. Will be getting a couple more in the spring.",

Soaked it in a vinegar solution and brushed it out. Still didn‚Äôt work.This is a great little solar fountain for the price. We have had it running for over a week now. When the sun is on the fountain, it‚Äôs on. When there is no sun, the fountain is off. We had some difficulty putting on the four stabilizers, but just stuck a rock in the bowl of the birdbath for birds to perch on. We do seem to have to fill up the birdbath more frequently, which isn‚Äôt a problem. I hope the fountain lasts a long time.",

    "reviewText": "There were so many options when I was shopping for solar fountains for my birdbath, all had a range of ratings and this one was priced right, so I decided to just order it! There's almost no assembly (mainly deciding how you want the water spray by selecting one of six nozzles), it started right up, and the strong flow almost emptied the birdbath immediately. Tried a smaller nozzle, and it works perfectly! SO if you want to try a fountain, this is an inexpensive but joyful start! I will probably purchase another one for backup. In the meantime, since it needs to be in the sun to work, the birdbath needs cleaning more often, and one can just spray off the intake part of the fountain too.",

I did not - it just needs full sun, otherwise it will will work intermittently, not full stream. I read this in the pamphlet, but only after thinking I had a broken one.

    "reviewText": "I just finished my yard for spring and put 2 of these \"fountains\" in bird baths. Neither one works. I live in Phoenix, AZ and the sun shines directly on the fountains but very little water comes out. I tried all of the attachments and there is not enough water pressure to make any difference. I tried to return them but was told that because I waited over 30 days (6 weeks to be exact) they are not refundable even if defective.Please save your money and don't bother. If you purchase them, try them out immediately so you may be able to get a refund.",

    "reviewText": "I live in the Coachella Valley. Summers here are brutal with temps from 110+ on average. The picture window where the fountain sits in front of gets the full brunt of the sun for most of the day here. But this little fountain has survived one hellish summer so far and then some! (If my fountain could talk! ü§îüòÜ) It is still running much to the delight of my kitty who loves to study it while she's waiting for a lizard, bunny or a bird to pop by. I placed my fountain outside in a somewhat shallow plastic recepticle that I got at the 99¬¢ store. Nothing fancy. So here are some longevity tips that work for me and will probably work for you.Keep plenty of pure water in your recepticle. Be sure to keep an eye on it during the day to make sure the water stays at an optimum level. Water levels go down because of evaporation and water being splashed either by the action of the fountain or wildlife playing in it. I just keep a hose or water container close by to quickly refill it. Clean the motor periodically depending on use. Keep your recepticle clean. Can't stress that enough. That means scrub it clean bcuz of slime/dirt buildup. If you've placed the fountain in a birdbath, you also need to scrub out the dirt and slime impurities often. Don't neglect this important step because it totally helps with the overall function of your solar fountain. Also clean your device. I can't stress that enough either. I take a power nozzle and spray the entire underside of it and gently swipe off any slime or dirt with your fingers to get around and under the tubes and motor housing on the underside.. And Yes!! You can power nozzle the motor. It blows out dirt and slime!! I do it all the time. I also do a periodic vinegar cleanse to it. Fill your recepticle with water. Stir in approx 1/4 cup per gallon of water. Use basic plain vinegar (acv, white. Do NOT use any other kind of vinegar) put your cleaned fountain in the water and let it run in the sunshine for 2 days. Maybe longer if you get less full sunshine. After 2+ days, dump the vinegar water, rinse device and power wash the underside again as little round gel like formations may have grown underneath, then add clean water again, add the device and set it in the sun again. It will be like new. The vinegar clears out scum and calcium buildup inside the device which causes a flow reduction or just stops working altogether. I do this once/mo usually or when I see my fountain struggling to work.There are no switches or controls. The solar motor is all it needs. And with some love and attention it will live a long time. I love my fountain. But I bought it for my indoor kitty and I think think she loves it more than me üòÇ",

    "reviewText": "This fountain worked really well for about a month. We put it in a large clear tray that you would use for the bottom of a house plant. It was a very inexpensive bird bath for our desert yard and the birds loved it while it worked.The pump gets clogged very easily, which eventually leads to the pump failing. Maybe if you were to wash it off daily, it might last longer. We just didn't take the time to do this. We ended up purchasing a more expensive fountain that came with a filter and had a battery to work when the sun went down.",

I am not using any nozzle and when the sun hits the solar panel, it just Bubbles the water which is fine for intended use.The birds like it.",

Ours works much better if I use a nozzle head that creates a lower and wider spray. We really like hearing the water when we sit in the back yard. So relaxing.",

    "reviewText": "I have purchased different solar bird bath fountains over the years and this has been the worst.When I opened the box I had doubts immediately. I should have returned it rather than throw into the bin but at this price it was more bother than I needed. It would not even perform in the direct sunlight. I have good experience with these pumps so I performed every task I know and how I keep my others going. This one did not want to start at all. I did noticed that the solar panel did have a strange white line going through it on one side so obviously damaged. This company needs to get their customer service dept performing better control before shipping out.",

This is simple to assemble and comes with a good number of spray heads for different patterns. It works very well and the birds seem to be good with it. A small note: this is a powerful pump. When the sun hits, this pump will put water at least a foot in the air. This is a nice feature but if the wind is blowing a fair amount, it will take the spray over the side of the birdbath.",

    "reviewText": "Bought this for a bird bath and it works great. The birds were leery at first but they love it now. I can't believe how this tiny solar panel generates enough electricity to run the fountain pump all day long, every day. The included extension rods prevent the fountain from reaching the edge of the bird bath, which in turn prevents the water from the fountain splashing out. One downside of the fountain is that the water will evaporate faster than it otherwise would, very noticible here in Arizona. Can't rate durability because have had the fountain for only 2 weeks, but so far it is great. Would certainly buy again!",

Not a real problem, but it should be noted. Overall, happy with purchase.",

The second problem is that I can‚Äôt get the unit to stay centered in my bird bath. It floats freely and I lose water over the sides. I need to find a stand that will still allow the water to be pumped through the fountain. (not a huge issue but it bugs me) It was inexpensive so I can live with the issues.",

As all of us need a drink. Fountain sprays are nice and have different heads for different patterns. Very cute economical way to add beauty to your garden. Works when suns out pretty long, when sun is down, they shut down in a while. Perfect you don't need to worry about turning off, just let nature take care of it.",

The instructions were poor, but it was easy to figure out. The problem I had was not the fault of the product. Each sprayer worked beautifully and looked great, but 3,5w was simply too much for my 17‚Äù wide, 3‚Äù deep bath. Set on the lowest spray setting and using the head that did not go high was even too much. 5 mph wind on a sunny day blew the water out of the bath leaving nothing in the bowl within 2 hours. The only one that worked without spitting the water out of the bowl was the bubbler. Additionally, the first and replacement set did not come with the pieces described and pictured, although I did like the ones it came with, you may not. It did not have the high center tube. The birds were attracted to all the spray settings. The instructions lacked a description of how and when to clean the filter, which is an important piece of information. I‚Äôll keep this one, but will order a different brand in the future.",

If you want an eco-friendly way to beautify your garden, this solar fountain water pump is a great choice!",

    "reviewText": "The Aisitin 3.5W solar fountain is a great buy. It has a very strong output as long as it's directly in the sunlight. Even when the sun is obscured by clouds, the pump will still work, although not as strongly as in the sunlight. The 3 arms can be positioned easily, and prove to be very helpful in keeping the fountain in the middle of the birdbath, which helps keep the water from spraying out over the sides. The battery has lasted the entire 4 months I've owned the fountain. I would definitely buy this again and would highly recommend.",

    "reviewText": "The product came with a number of different fountain nozzles that added to the experience. However and in my case where I had placed it the sun did not shine on the product as is required. Taking it out of the bird bath and placing it in direct sunlight made the product work very well. Unfortunately, the birdbath was in a specific spot that could not be changed in regard to our Landscaping, so I had to return it. I really like all of the different nozzle features and the force of the water when it was in direct sunlight but again it just did not work out for me. I would recommend purchasing this product if you have a good sun lite location. I also liked the arms that allowed the product to float in the middle of the bird bath.",

If you ever get a cloud forget it, it's not gonna function! If you live in the desert or put it up on your roof lol then maybe unless you to can have a cloud or touch of shade.Description :Stable and Durable: Larger 7.1 inch diameter solar panel cover to transfer stronger power to make fountain spray more lasting and stable. It get fast to work automatically once it put in water with sunlight.Take away:Stable,durable, sunlight, the key word's used in the description, but I don't read 100% direct sunlight used anywhere! The one star is fair as it does come on, but can't say it work's as advertised by a long shot a loose meaning of sunlight because one could argue that you can't have daylight without sunlight, but it does not work in just normal daylight even on a clear day and 80 degrees.",

    "reviewText": "I have a planter tub of water on my deck that has some older solar fountains floating in it that still work, they make nice bubbly motions that reflect the sun's light into a nice sparkly feature that is quite pleasing. This newer one, I was able to use what I think is the more challenging attachments to make the higher reaching fountain spray design and it worked very well, even on a cloudy day, so it is a great addition because it works better than older models. I would recommend getting it if you like to use floating solar fountains, they are improving as time goes along.",

    "reviewText": "The birds love these little fountains in their bird bath, or in the pond. The only issue is it is quite windy where I am and the wind will push them to the side so that they are spraying out of the bath or pond. Easy fix though, I just hung a heavy washer from the bottom as an anchor and they work perfectly now. The plus is no batteries or wires, they are completely solar so on a real cloudy day they do not spray quite as high, but they work, and at night they shut down so you are not wearing out parts. Also very easy to clean when debris get sucked into the pump. Will be getting a couple more in the spring.",

Soaked it in a vinegar solution and brushed it out. Still didn‚Äôt work.This is a great little solar fountain for the price. We have had it running for over a week now. When the sun is on the fountain, it‚Äôs on. When there is no sun, the fountain is off. We had some difficulty putting on the four stabilizers, but just stuck a rock in the bowl of the birdbath for birds to perch on. We do seem to have to fill up the birdbath more frequently, which isn‚Äôt a problem. I hope the fountain lasts a long time.",

    "reviewText": "There were so many options when I was shopping for solar fountains for my birdbath, all had a range of ratings and this one was priced right, so I decided to just order it! There's almost no assembly (mainly deciding how you want the water spray by selecting one of six nozzles), it started right up, and the strong flow almost emptied the birdbath immediately. Tried a smaller nozzle, and it works perfectly! SO if you want to try a fountain, this is an inexpensive but joyful start! I will probably purchase another one for backup. In the meantime, since it needs to be in the sun to work, the birdbath needs cleaning more often, and one can just spray off the intake part of the fountain too.",

I did not - it just needs full sun, otherwise it will will work intermittently, not full stream. I read this in the pamphlet, but only after thinking I had a broken one.

    "reviewText": "Really great addition to a kids water table! There is one problem I had with it, however. There are four little plastic ‚Äústraws‚Äù that attach to the sides to help pull in water for the fountain. My standard water table does not allow for all four to fit, so I had to cut them, and now the fountain does not work quite as intended. Still a fun toy, but definitely be aware that if you are purchasing for your child‚Äôs water table, measure beforehand! Also‚Ä¶don‚Äôt leave it out in the sun in an empty water table. Or else you might go crazy, as I did, trying to find the wounded-sounding animal in your yard‚Ä¶. (The solar panel aspect makes it continue to try to pump water even when not in said water!)",

I tried to return them but was told that because I waited over 30 days (6 weeks to be exact) they are not refundable even if defective.Please save your money and don't bother.

    "reviewText": "I live in the Coachella Valley. Summers here are brutal with temps from 110+ on average. The picture window where the fountain sits in front of gets the full brunt of the sun for most of the day here. But this little fountain has survived one hellish summer so far and then some! (If my fountain could talk! ü§îüòÜ) It is still running much to the delight of my kitty who loves to study it while she's waiting for a lizard, bunny or a bird to pop by. I placed my fountain outside in a somewhat shallow plastic recepticle that I got at the 99¬¢ store. Nothing fancy. So here are some longevity tips that work for me and will probably work for you.Keep plenty of pure water in your recepticle. Be sure to keep an eye on it during the day to make sure the water stays at an optimum level. Water levels go down because of evaporation and water being splashed either by the action of the fountain or wildlife playing in it. I just keep a hose or water container close by to quickly refill it. Clean the motor periodically depending on use. Keep your recepticle clean. Can't stress that enough. That means scrub it clean bcuz of slime/dirt buildup. If you've placed the fountain in a birdbath, you also need to scrub out the dirt and slime impurities often. Don't neglect this important step because it totally helps with the overall function of your solar fountain. Also clean your device. I can't stress that enough either. I take a power nozzle and spray the entire underside of it and gently swipe off any slime or dirt with your fingers to get around and under the tubes and motor housing on the underside.. And Yes!! You can power nozzle the motor. It blows out dirt and slime!! I do it all the time. I also do a periodic vinegar cleanse to it. Fill your recepticle with water. Stir in approx 1/4 cup per gallon of water. Use basic plain vinegar (acv, white. Do NOT use any other kind of vinegar) put your cleaned fountain in the water and let it run in the sunshine for 2 days. Maybe longer if you get less full sunshine. After 2+ days, dump the vinegar water, rinse device and power wash the underside again as little round gel like formations may have grown underneath, then add clean water again, add the device and set it in the sun again. It will be like new. The vinegar clears out scum and calcium buildup inside the device which causes a flow reduction or just stops working altogether. I do this once/mo usually or when I see my fountain struggling to work.There are no switches or controls. The solar motor is all it needs. And with some love and attention it will live a long time. I love my fountain. But I bought it for my indoor kitty and I think think she loves it more than me üòÇ",

It was a very inexpensive bird bath for our desert yard and the birds loved it while it worked.The pump gets clogged very easily, which eventually leads to the pump failing. Maybe if you were to wash it off daily, it might last longer. We just didn't take the time to do this. We ended up purchasing a more expensive fountain that came with a filter and had a battery to work when the sun went down.",

Ours works much better if I use a nozzle head that creates a lower and wider spray. We really like hearing the water when we sit in the back yard. So relaxing.",

    "reviewText": "Good value for the price.Using this for a bird bath so it has some caveats for this purpose.....It comes with plenty of nozzlesPROS-Lots of options to choose from with the spray tips included.-Easy plug-n-play setup.-works great as long as in DIRECT SUNCONS- even without the extension and with the shortest tip, for my 2\" deep, 12\" round bird bath it will still spray over the radius. Therefore, I have to keep an eye on it and refill throughout the day so the little motor doesn't burn up from running dry.Tip: since birds like to carry seed with them, I had to add a mesh fabric around the body to prevent tiny seeds and debris from going through the intake. Without it, the smallest particles would make it all the way to the tip, block a hole, and cause the spray to go rogue- not just N S E and West but throw in a random NNW at a 20 degree angle and out of the bowl.I still consider this a good value because it works as stated, just nothing fancy. No lights. No nighttime Bellagio fountain show in the backyard but birds like it.",

    "reviewText": "Pros: It works nicely. So far seems to have a good power for it's size. Has the perfect spray for a bird bath. Birds are loving it. I'm honestly not sure what people are complaining about parts not fitting??? they may have gotten a different model or were missing a piece??? Everything went together easily for me. It's got a nice size spray so you're going to want a pretty decent size bath or the overspray may drain your bird bath quickly.Cons: The solar panel needs SOLID direct sunlight. In the summer heat, I prefer to keep the bath in the shade to keep it from getting too hot. Gave it a 4 because I would preferred the cord to be longer so I can keep the bath under the tree and the panel in a part of the yard that's full sun. The cord is not bad, just not long enough.Note: Niether pro nor con...The panel does not have battery storage. When the sun is gone, the pump stops (I knew this before purchase). This does not bother me at all since the birds don't normally \"bathe\" in the dark.",

    "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice basic little pump",
    "reviewText": "This cute little solar pump was just what I wanted. Something small and inexpensive to keep the water moving in a little birdbath dish out in the backyard where there is no access to electricity. It is as advertised, very basic, without even an on/off button. This is NOT the type of fountain that charges up a battery and then works consistently. If the sun is shining directly on the solar panel, it works. If it is very shady or at night, it does not pump. It comes on an off and varies in intensity according to the sun. The birds are happy, the water stays clean longer, and the sight and sound of splashing water is soothing. There are no real instructions, but once you figure out the \"puzzle\" on the box showing the various combinations of the spray heads with or without the extender/riser you will certainly find a combination that works for your own little fountain. I am using it without a spray head, just the short extender pipe since the water pan I have is rather small and it was spraying out of the pan with the spray heads when the wind blew. With the no-spayhead option, it looks a little like a drinking fountain. Picture attached. I like it very much.",

    "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This little pump is absolutely FANTASTIC for the price! The solar power aspect makes it convenient to use almost anywhere. It comes with a bunch of different nozzles but we actually fitted it with a straw to use in our makeshift bird bath and it worked perfectly! There was zero setup, just out of the box and into the water. Sun came out and it started flowing. The only downfall is on cloudy days or in the shade from a tree, it doesn't run consistently so if that is an issue, you may want to consider one that has a battery built in as well. Cannot complain at all for the price though üê•üí¶",

    "reviewText": "This pump worked very well, so well in fact that I couldn't use a spry head or it would blow out the water with the slightest breeze. I took off the head and it worked fine. Then, one day I went out and there was almost no flow. Ok, I guess I need to clean the sponge filter. I did so, reassembled it, and ........nothing!This is a great pump if you need it for a few weeks for a special occasion, but otherwise, no dice. Too bad as the solar panel is large and worked well. All I NEED IS Q NEW PUMP, not the tubing or solar panel, but I can't buy just the pump. I've purchased this two times and no bueno either time. Ok, I tried one last time to clean it.I brought it in and removed the sponge filter, yes, it is nothing like the picture to clean. You can't remove anything except a small piece of porous sponge. I removed that and cleaned as much as I could, then took a toothbrush to the \"frame' that holds it, and when I put it back together, voila, it worked again. So the solar collector is great, the pump is meh, and the filter system is the weakest link. I anticipate cleaning the sponge filter about two more times before it falls apart. Without it, the particulates will get sucked into the pump, causing failure since you can't get to the pump motor. I know this is not a 1/4 horse pond pump but a little better filter, or cleaning access would go a long way to the longevity of this pump! I'll change my star level from 1 to 2.",

    "reviewText": "I have tried a fair few solar pumps before and thought as the price was so cheap I wasn't going to lose much by giving this a try. Worked perfectly in a garden water feature, the suction cups keeping the pump in place are very strong. There is a variety of fountain attachments to try. The lead from the pump to the solar panel is long enough to go from the water feature and then be attached to the top of a 6ft fence to capture more of the sun. Obviously if the sun isn't hitting the panel then the pump won't work as there isn't a battery back up. But for the price I thought it was better than I was expecting. Ideal for a small water feature or bird bath.",
